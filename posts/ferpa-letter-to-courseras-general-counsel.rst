I have written the following letter to Coursera's General Counsel. 


  March 20, 2015

  Dear Mr Liu,

  I am contacting you since you are General Counsel of Coursera. I would like to get access to the entirety of my record as a student on Coursera. 

  The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1232g) mandates that students should get access to a copy of all their educational records. This includes any emails e-mails, notes, memoranda, video, audio, or other documentary material maintained by the educational institution. FERPA also prohibits the imposition of a fee to review documents (per 34 CFR Sec. 99.11(b)).

  I am aware that Coursera does not believe it is subject to FERPA. Note however that
  
  - its Terms of Service refer explicity to "students" [1];  
  
  - that the vocabulary shift from "student" to "learner" by Coursera employees occured after I signed up for the platform;
  
  - Vivek Goel, at the time Coursera's Chief Academic Strategist, said to the Chronicle of Higher Education that the company followed the "principles" of FERPA when handling the data of its users [2].

  Of particular interest to me is information about any of my posts that might have been deleted or silent-banned. By silent-banning I refer to the practice of flagging a forum post, in such a way that 
  
  - the post is still visible to the original poster;
  
  - the post is invisible to anyone else;
  
  - it is invisible to the original poster that his/her post has been flagged in that way.

  I know the practice is common on some online forums, but I am hard pressed to find a face-to-face equivalent of that type of situation in a classroom, or why it would be justified in a learning environment (except to reduce TA labor costs). It obviously raises significant free speech issues if suddenly people's speech can be limited in such non-transparent ways. 

  In particular, I know of two instances where this happened and as part of this FERPA request would like to get access to all relevant records so I can understand the reasoning and timing behind these silent bans. In one case presumably the ban was imposed by one of your contractors (who is also a professor at a US institution), while in another it was presumably done by one of your employees.

  If you choose to redact any portion of any documents responsive to this request, please provide a written explanation for the redaction including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) upon which you rely. Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material. 

  As per 34 CFR Sec. 99.10(b), these records must be made available for my inspection within 45 days of this request.

  I look forward to receiving a full response within 45 calendar days.

  Paul-Olivier Dehaye
