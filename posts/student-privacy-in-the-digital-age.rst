Today, US President Obama is due to call for laws covering student privacy. To quote the `New York Times <http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/12/us/politics/obama-to-call-for-laws-covering-data-hacking-and-student-privacy.html>`_:

     The president will also propose the Student Data Privacy Act, which would prohibit technology firms from profiting from information collected in schools as teachers adopt tablets, online services and Internet-connected software, officials said. 

This is an interesting development, very much top-down. The reality on the ground is that tech companies can do just about anything they want with student data. For instance, they can casually diss existing regulations. Quoting the `Chronicle of Higher Education <http://chronicle.com/article/Are-MOOC-Takers-Students-/150325/>`_  (December 3rd 2014):

     Coursera, by contrast, does not believe federal student-privacy laws apply to MOOCs, according to Vivek Goel, the companyâ€™s chief academic strategist. But the company does follow the "principles" of Ferpa when handling the data of its users, according to Mr. Goel.

Note that noone cares what Goel "believes": this quote only constitutes a personal commitment, he is replaceable, and indeed had left Coursera within a month of that statement. It also matters very little whether Coursera follows the principles of FERPA now. Voluntary compliance in the present, while not tapping into one of your intended revenue streams, is very different from promised regulatory compliance in the future. 

Obama's proposal is also bound to leave many shady areas in a field that is evolving very fast. One of the main questions would concern non-US students in MOOCs, at a time when `Asia is emerging as the World's edtech laboratory <http://getpocket.com/a/read/813428833>`_ and `choices made in Europe will have a lasting impact on issues surrounding privacy <https://twitter.com/Buttarelli_G/status/443641146816729088>`_ (Buttarelli is European Data Protection Supervisor). This will fit into a larger struggle re-defining modern privacy laws, when data flows become crucial to national security. 

In any case, it is my belief that these issues also need bottom-up approaches. For this reason, in October 2014 I filed a `Safe Harbor request with Coursera <http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/how-to-file-a-safe-harbor-request-for-your-personal-data.html>`_. Safe Harbor is a program that authorises US companies to conduct business with EU based companies, provided they offer guarantees concerning data protection. This certification is a *sine qua non* if Coursera wants to conduct business with EU-based universities. Under this program, any user has the right to request access to their data. Indeed, a couple weeks later (after sorting through several issues), Coursera did send me some of my data. However, this data was incomplete and partly inaccurate. In addition, it did not provide much light on what Coursera intends to do with this data. In reaction, back in December, I filed a second Safe Harbor request, asking many questions concerning their intentions with this data. Since Coursera still has not responded to those questions, I decided today to initiate the next step of this procedure: in accordance with `Coursera's filing at the Federal Trade Commission <http://safeharbor.export.gov/companyinfo.aspx?id=26126>`_, I have contacted the recourse mechanism, i.e. the International Center for Dispute Resolution division of the American Arbitration Association. 

I have also notified the FTC, the Data Protection Officers at the Swiss cantonal and federal levels, as well as three EU parliamentarians: Julia Reda, Marietje Schaake and Jan Albrecht.
