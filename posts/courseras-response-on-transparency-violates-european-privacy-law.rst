I have asked the Coursera MOOC startup for my personal data, under the US/Switzerland agreement on data transfers. Coursera's response violates European and Swiss laws. This post will explain the request and the pre-legal recourses I have initiated. 

First, a bit of background. In November 2012, I have started using the Coursera platform, as a student (and thus agreed to the `Terms of Use <https://www.coursera.org/about/terms>`_). In June/July 2014, I taught a course on the platform, called *Teaching goes Massive: new skills required*. This required signing additional contracts which waived (among many others) my right to sue Coursera for libel. 

Actually, my course was not allowed to finish as intended, and I was censored before I could explain Coursera's business model and its implications (notably on privacy). Various online trickery was used, such as moderating some of the posts I wrote explaining the situation to students (in my own course!). Legal threats were made against me, and I was prevented from explaining the situation to journalists. Finally, Coursera executives publicly called for sanctions from my employer, after (to the best of my knowledge) actively misleading them. I have written an account of what happened `here <./short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html>`_. 

Of course, this violates two constitutional rights: free speech (in the U.S.) and academic freedom (in Switzerland). 

Nevertheless, the current situation is interesting, since I am now legally tied to Coursera as both instructor and student.  Regardless of which tie applies, the Coursera's privacy policy explicitly afford me the protections of the Safe Harbor program, a joint initiative of the European Union and the United States regulating the sharing of personal data (Switzerland's is a copy of the EU's). 

In October 2014, I filed a `first request <./how-to-file-a-safe-harbor-request-for-your-personal-data.html>`_ for my personal data. In December 2014, I filed a second, for both more data and more information on how it would be used. Safe Harbor can be a bit tricky to apply: privacy is hard to regulate without killing innovation, and for this reason Safe Harbor relies on self-enforcement by the company. This is however only a first step, and I intend with my prodding to initiate a second step. 

In any case, here is Coursera's response (with minor formatting, such as boldfacing what Coursera copy pasted from my December request). My comments appear in [brackets]. 

Coursera's response
===================

Dear Professor Dehaye,

Thank you for your patience. As a reminder, our Safe Harbor Policy, which can be found here on our site, applies to personal information transferred to us from the EU/Switzerland. Much of the data that has been requested falls outside of the scope of our Safe Harbor Policy, is simply not available, or is otherwise unreasonable for us to retrieve. Below, please see individual responses to the follow up requests that were made.

A versioned history of the data held by Coursera, not just a static dump of the last "active" data. In other words, I would like to also have access to all the timing metadata too (and in fact, any additional metadata your company might have).
The versioned history and timing metadata are not “personal information” for purposes of the Safe Harbor Policy. This information is also not the type of information that we review and the data are extremely difficult or, in some cases, impossible to retrieve.

All information associated to the deletion and moderation of my forum posts (including timing information). I would also appreciate a quick explanation of where to find this in the dumps, since my posts that have been moderated do not show up in what I got so far.
The reason for those two requests is that some of my posts have been "silent banned", for instance in the course "Massive Teaching: new skills required". Yet I do not see this in the data you have sent to me. This would allow me to establish for instance whether my deleted/moderated posts showed up when journalists took a closer look at that course.
We do not have timing information for moderation or deletion of forum posts. The dump we provided you should be a complete record of your posts, and will indicate whether they were deleted.

The versioned history of all the course materials associated to "Massive Teaching: new skills required"
As noted above, the versioned history does not fall under the definition of “personal information” set forth in the Safe Harbor Policy.

Copies of the contracts, as signed by Coursera, my employer and me (I only have copies signed by just me, except for the "Use of Course Content" contract, which I have never seen and even less signed).
Please see the contract attached.

The data dump I have received did not include any information contained in my instructor profile. Again, the metadata is of interest to me: when exactly did I lose my instructor rights (despite claims to the contrary by a Coursera spokeswoman to Inside Higher Ed). Also, was a second instructor account created, for the sole purpose of pretending I was still involved in the course? My profile is still world viewable, yet I cannot modify it (I do not think this is covered by the image rights I have signed away).
This metadata does not fall under the definition of “personal information.” As with other requested information, it is not information we typically review and would require substantial effort to obtain. Likewise, whether a second instructor account was created also falls outside of a Safe Harbor Policy access request. However, to answer your question: our platform required a copy of the instructor account to be generated in order for the course to be displayed. No communications or activities were ever issued from the account.

Any internal Coursera emails associated with that course. Being its sole instructor, it is clear to me that this is data associated to me. In fact, my employer has publicly made that point in the "Chronicle of Higher Education", only to be reinforced by Coursera's Chief Academic Strategist in "Inside Higher Ed".
Internal emails about the course between Coursera employees are not “personal information” under the Safe Harbor Policy. Emails with third parties, such as administrators at Zurich, would additionally be subject to our confidentiality obligations to these third parties and, as a result, cannot be disclosed.

Please inform me of any data that has been collected or computed about me. This includes any of the hundreds of A/B tests that I might have unknowingly participated in, but also any aggregate data computed about the course "Massive Teaching: new skills required" (for instance, success rate). Again, I consider this information to be about me, since it can be used to quantify my teaching performance (or more precisely to put numbers up and claim they correlate with a measure of quality). It also includes information such as: my login times and the number of student complaints, since this data was raised as problematic with my employer when my course was stopped. Make sure however to include the timing of those complaints, and the number of students who actually complained.
In addition, please provide me with information about any third party you have shared information with about me (and, again, the timing). 
Aggregate data on your course does not constitute “personal information” under the Safe Harbor Policy.
Regarding a list of vendors, our obligation is to provide the types of third parties. These types are: our hosting platforms (e.g. AWS), analytics platforms (e.g. Google BigQuery, Amplitude, and Mixpanel), office software (e.g. Google Docs), and support ticketing platforms (e.g. Zendesk).

Regarding student complaints: these fall into both the category of us not having the data (since we no longer use or have access to our former ticketing system) and the category of being unreasonable to retrieve, as they would require someone from Coursera manually looking through all forum posts on your course. We also have a confidentiality obligation to our students that would make it unreasonable to disclose many comments.

This would certainly include your hosting provider, and the captioning company, but not just:
- did you make non-public allegation against me with individual students? if so, what was the content of the allegations?
We do not need to answer this under Safe Harbor, but the answer is no.

did you actually open my course for journalists after blocking it to "regular" users? Did you share with them the "moderated" view (see 1 and 2) or the raw view of the data? We do not need to answer this under Safe Harbor, but the answer is no.
Do you intend to share it with third parties? Will that require my consent? Would you require my consent to share my data with potential employers? With universities who want to do research on learning? With other companies who want to do that type of research? With a company looking to acquire Coursera?
Any sharing of personal information is done in compliance with our Privacy Policy and our Safe Harbor Policy. Under these policies, for example, your personal information may have been shared with the universities providing courses in which you have enrolled. Also, as mentioned above, your information has been shared with vendors that provide hosting and other services to Coursera. Under our research policy, which was approved by a committee of university representatives appointed by our University Advisory Board, research involving your data would require appropriate institutional review by a recognized research institution. Research findings will typically be reported at the aggregate level, and -- in your capacity as a learner -- your personal identity will not be publicly disclosed without your express consent.

What additional data do you intend to compute on the run of the "Massive Teaching" course in the future? (again, this might be aggregated on users but is closely tied to me as an individual)
This question does not fall under our Safe Harbor obligations.

What additional data do you intend to compute based on my profile as a student?
This question does not fall under our Safe Harbor obligations.

Thank you,
The Coursera Team

, and did get *what Coursera unilaterally determined it was obliged to give me*. Indeed, Safe Harbor relies on distributed regulation: given the complexity of data and privacy issues, and the rapid pace of evolution in the commercialisation of consumer personal data, regulators have so far mostly relied on each industry to self-regulate.

Coursera's response came, and was only mildly satisfactory on data (see below). Additionally, Safe Harbor also requires the company to inform users on its future uses of the data, *at the moment of collection*. I thus filed a second requests, for more data and more information. This was in December 2014. The only responses I got announced m
