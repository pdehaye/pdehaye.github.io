One of those is Safe Harbour, which has drastic implication for privacy &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/coursera-and-safe-harbour-of-student-data.html#id2" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. In principle, Safe Harbour is a good idea: it creates little (business) friction but ensures some form of citizen oversight over the fastest evolving areas of e-commerce, by enforcing transparency. It is being heavily tested though: in light of the Snowden revelations, there is growing understanding that this data originally held for commercial reasons is also a leverage of power. Andrus Ansip, the European Commissioner for Digital Single Market (designate)  &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.euractiv.com/sections/innovation-enterprise/ansip-threatens-suspend-safe-harbour-data-agreement-us-308962"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/europe-digital-nominee-demands-stronger-u-s-data-rules/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; in his hearings to be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id2" rules="none"&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label"&gt;&lt;col&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/coursera-and-safe-harbour-of-student-data.html#id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Let's say a US company wants to do business in the EU. The EU, well aware of dangers associated with big data businesses, is concerned about the privacy of its citizens. At the same time, it does not want to hamper innovation. The solution found with Safe Harbour is to at least ensure transparency: any European citizen can ask to consult their data, what it is used for, etc. The situation was different a few years ago: I had to wait for Facebook to set up European Headquartes in Ireland to ask for access to my data.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id3" rules="none"&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label"&gt;&lt;col&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;[2]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Ansip is also former Prime Minister of Estonia, a country very much ahead in everything digital. One can even &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/estonia-first-country-offer-e-residency-digital-citizenship-1468766"&gt;become e-citizen there and get digital residency&lt;/a&gt;, with minimal requirements.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id4" rules="none"&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label"&gt;&lt;col&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;[3]&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Not very promising actually: within a few minutes of my original email, I got a canned message back sending me to assistance forums. I replied that this was not an answer to my request, and got the same canned message once again... Possibly I am the first Coursera user to make use of Safe Harbour.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><category>coursera</category><category>privacy</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/coursera-and-safe-harbour-of-student-data.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2014 18:33:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What I am doing with MOOCs and why (June 2nd)</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/what-i-am-doing-with-moocs-and-why-june-2nd.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk on July 2nd about MOOCs. The goal was to explain to interested individuals the different potential futures of MOOCs, informed with the perspective of a mathematician. A lot of what I say is undoubtedly naive, but this was four months ago, an eternity in the MOOC world. And in any case I prefer to be attacked for things I said in a talk setting at my own institution to colleagues rather than things I {reportedly, supposedly} said to students in a closed setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of my talk was &lt;em&gt;What I am doing with MOOCs and why&lt;/em&gt; (apologies for bad sound, one hour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width="425" height="344" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/NCLHWaYxMyM?rel=0&amp;amp;hd=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gave this talk in anticipation of a conference co-organised the next day with Stanford in Zurich, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://user.math.uzh.ch/dehaye/edx_meeting.html"&gt;the first OpenEdX conference&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.openedx.org"&gt;OpenEdX&lt;/a&gt; is the platform that powers &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.edx.org"&gt;edx.org&lt;/a&gt;. This conference has now become a regular event, with the next one on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://con.openedx.org/"&gt;Harvard campus&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the conference, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Sites-powered-by-Open-edX/93583d8f92cf692766180eca247960294114af7a"&gt;24 separate installation sites were listed&lt;/a&gt; on the relevant Github pages, almost all of them in English. Four months later, the project now counts &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Sites-powered-by-Open-edX"&gt;47 sites&lt;/a&gt; all over the world, a significant progress! It also now has &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/List-of-XBlocks"&gt;23 different publicly available Xblocks&lt;/a&gt;, which are extensions of OpenEdX to customise it to particular needs (only a couple had been released back then).
As I explain this in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://collab.switch.ch/p26oy3gl9aj/?launcher=false&amp;amp;fcsContent=true&amp;amp;pbMode=normal"&gt;first 4 minutes of this video&lt;/a&gt;, privacy issues are very significant in Switzerland, Europe, Quebec and the United States and motivated me to convene the workshop. This comes right after the Snowden scandals, and it is very hard for large actors outside the USA to trust a service like Amazon Web Services. A positive outcome was that it helped crystallise a need for separate service vendors, which edX then helped to get started. There are now eight different &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/List-of-Open-edX-service-providers"&gt;commercial vendors&lt;/a&gt;, happily customising the platform to suit new needs.  The conference also helped a lot of local startups/nonprofits get a jump start in the MOOC space, such as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.blue-planet-life.org/"&gt;Blue Planet Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I was a bit disappointed however in the answer he gave to a question I asked at the end of his talk. It really did seem like noone had yet practically considered how MOOCs might change entire disciplines for research, or create new ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>coursera</category><category>crowdsourcing</category><category>gsiemens</category><category>mooc</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/what-i-am-doing-with-moocs-and-why-june-2nd.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2014 12:41:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Building trust in #massiveteaching, through visuals</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/building-trust-in-massiveteaching-through-visuals.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the module on trust in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.connectedcourses.net"&gt;Connected Courses&lt;/a&gt;, I would like to share some tricks that I have used to visually build trust across cultures. It was especially powerful for me to watch Jonathan Worth's video on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://phonar.org/2014/09/leveraging-you-why-in-answer-to-mike-wesch/"&gt;Leveraging your why&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/building-trust-in-massiveteaching-through-visuals.html#id5" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth offers that his "Why?" for #phonar is actually citizen journalism, and discusses a photo by John Stanmeyer, winner of the World Press Photo 2013 award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this brings me back to, this is my ‘why?’ So this image is the winning image from the World Press Photo this year, by a photographer called John Stanmeyer, and this is why it annoys me so much. Because it’s by a photographer called John Stanmeyer. These are African immigrants standing on a beach, trying to get a phone signal before they jump in the water. Let me just get this right, “on the shore of Djibouti City at night raising their phones in an attempt to capture an inexpensive signal from neighbouring Somalia”. These are the people that aren’t in my class. They’re holding these smart devices which can all take pictures, and yet it takes a photographer from New York to bring it back and we can now talk about it.  What these people need is to be able to be trusted and to be heard, and these are the people that aren’t in the class. So this is my why, and this is my way marker, so this is definitely the best and most exciting thing that’s come out of my classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://phonar.org/2014/09/leveraging-you-why-in-answer-to-mike-wesch/"&gt;Jonathan Worth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of my efforts with my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.coursera.org/course/massiveteaching"&gt;Coursera course&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Massive Teaching: News skills required&lt;/em&gt; were some interesting blend of Worth's efforts in #phonar and in #connected_courses. Let's first consider the exact opposite of what I did. Relax, prepare some popcorn, and watch the following video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width="425" height="344" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0rmJqQotDWo?rel=0&amp;amp;hd=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clealy this video exploits the elite university brand together with a lot of pixie dust to try to cement this elite brand even more. The "why?" of this MIT video certainly shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as in Worth's #phonar course leading up to citizen journalism, I am hoping with parts of &lt;em&gt;Massive Teaching&lt;/em&gt; to enable some form of citizen-MOOCing, to create a small distributed network of video production, with no sacrifice on the quality of the education provided. My sidegoal was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to find the cheapest way to produce video, but to find a visual style that could appeal equally to institutions (even very elite) and lonely individuals anywhere in the world &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/building-trust-in-massiveteaching-through-visuals.html#id6" id="id2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sidegoal was to make for a more homogeneous and egalitarian pool of video producers &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/building-trust-in-massiveteaching-through-visuals.html#id7" id="id3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;, but it goes further. How do we enable anyone anywhere to build trust with &lt;strong&gt;connected diverse individuals&lt;/strong&gt; (a concept that I used in a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/moocs-as-inventions-chals14.html"&gt;recent talk&lt;/a&gt; and is obviously core to #ccourses)? Let's consider one of my videos, where the topic is precisely on tracking of individuals by large corporations, drawing parallels between educational analytics and AdWords style advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width="425" height="344" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qOCln176bM4?rel=0&amp;amp;hd=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;img alt="../crib.jpeg" class="align-right" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/crib.jpeg" style="width: 216.0px; height: 288.0px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;&lt;li&gt;it uses easily findable DUPLO pieces &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/building-trust-in-massiveteaching-through-visuals.html#id8" id="id4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; and paper cutouts;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel that using kids' toys produces emotional responses and increases trust;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my hands are there, and that makes the videos still personal (contrast with the expense at &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:CEDE@EPFL"&gt;CEDE@EPFL&lt;/a&gt; for their &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agbe9B5l_VI"&gt;invisible hand effect&lt;/a&gt;);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the production process is first audio, then video, and the two are completely separate (I replay the audio when filming the video). In this way I actually first write the transcript, record a reading, and then illustrate. It makes translations very easy: simply re-record the sound, at the pace of the video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I designed a recording studio out of IKEA furniture pieces (a crib, for instance for a cage, so it is easy to attach camera, light, etc); IKEA is not cheap enough but it gives wide reach. I have confidence that this can be improved drastically, by posting on sites such as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ikeahackers.net/"&gt;IKEAhackers&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I encouraged my students to do the same, by describing my process as throgouhly as possible (done here again);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None of those cheap tricks are new, it is mere borrowing of on-the-street intelligence of High School teachers and the Maker movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As stated, one of the sidegoals was to enable anyone to do this, and for anyone to create trust with anyone else, without necessarily going through a central authority (like that provided by my Coursera course). For this purpose, I selected some articles to help guide students on what might build trust across cultural divides, such as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.featureshoot.com/2013/03/photos-of-children-from-around-the-world-with-their-most-prized-possessions/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, which clearly echoes the emotional response I was referring to earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happened with &lt;em&gt;Massive Teaching&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, despite my best efforts it turns out that the fact that Coursera owned the channel was still &lt;em&gt;massively&lt;/em&gt; important. I might have made sure I owned all the content, and diluted as much as possible all ambient brands, I still needed Coursera for its reach (or at least I felt I did!). Going through them was not a smart way to challenge the general status quo in MOOCs, but the interesting paradox of #massiveteaching is that ultimately it is not the content that went missing, but rather the human (me, the instructor). The content was instead reinstated (well, actually only partially and with questionable motives), and I was unable to access the sources anymore, thereby losing some of my own content. This paradox was then compounded by further issues of trust and disinformation, where again access to communication channels was crucial. This account of course omits any of the students' perspectives, which must have been wildly different, depending on the activities they actually engaged in. With the instructor gone, only disaster was possible.&lt;/p&gt;

Indeed, the refereeing process, which is a form of  authority and power, is done double-blind, to prevent reinforcement of biases. In mathematics the author of a submitted paper is not anonymous to the referee, which is arguably a problem.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id8" rules="none"&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label"&gt;&lt;col&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/building-trust-in-massiveteaching-through-visuals.html#id4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This in itself is very interestingly pain point. Can I use a DUPLO piece as a tool? I had &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dearrichblog.blogspot.ch/2014/05/cut-out-animations-moocs-and-copyright.html"&gt;to ask a lawyer for that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><category>connected_course</category><category>coursera</category><category>epfl</category><category>massive_teaching</category><category>mit</category><category>trust</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/building-trust-in-massiveteaching-through-visuals.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2014 11:38:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>U Colorado system Coursera contract</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/u-colorado-system-coursera-contract.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Over at his blog, Jonathan Rees &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://moreorlessbunk.net/technology/as-the-learning-management-system-turns/"&gt;discusses the decision of the Colorado State University in Fort Collins to switch LMSes&lt;/a&gt;, from Blackboard to Canvas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He makes sly references to the fact that this blog post starts hitting very close to his own "home", since he is working himself at Colorado State University - Pueblo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a previous post on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/coursera-contracts-of-stony-brook-roma-unc-colorado-kentucky-michigan-utoronto-ucsc.html"&gt;Coursera contracts&lt;/a&gt;, I gathered together all the Coursera contracts that I could find online. This was in fact partly a response to repeated appeals he has done in the past for faculty to speak up across universities (see first line of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-ii.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of those contracts was from the University of Colorado system, it is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-Colorado.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I was wondering how the decision was taken in Colorado of joining Coursera in the first place, and if faculty were consulted on this. The comments are below, feel free to contribute (even anonymously if you would like).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I was also wondering how he (and other professors and administrators) would react to this present post, over which he has no control (and we haven't discussed this beforehand).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To increase likelihood that someone would respond, I also posted a comment on his blog sending readers here.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>coursera</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/u-colorado-system-coursera-contract.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2014 13:25:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>MOOCs as inventions #chals14</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/moocs-as-inventions-chals14.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished giving my talk on &lt;em&gt;MOOCs as inventions: opportunities and risks&lt;/em&gt; in Goteborg, at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;amp;q=%23chals14&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;#chals14&lt;/a&gt; meeting.

&lt;p&gt;In the talk, I discussed the idea that MOOCs are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine"&gt;social machines&lt;/a&gt; put in the hands of professors (thanks to my PhD student &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?id=assistenten&amp;amp;L=&amp;amp;key1=4144&amp;amp;key2=&amp;amp;key3=&amp;amp;keySemId="&gt;Helen Riedtmann&lt;/a&gt; for boiling down my ideas to this simple statement), and quoted Evgeny Morozov, which I am reading at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, it was much better to be last speaker of the morning, to offer a (hopefully constructive) balance to some of the other points made earlier. It also lead naturally to interesting discussions (including with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/the-president-and-vice-presidents/Pages/karin-markides-president.aspx"&gt;Karin Markides&lt;/a&gt;, who asked me a few questions above my pay grade. It is much easier to convey these ideas offline than online, but indeed the audience is smaller and different).  Still, the digital world was interesting too: I was glad to see how Twitter added to the talk &lt;strong&gt;for me&lt;/strong&gt; afterwards (something I am not used to, since very few mathematicians use Twitter), which helped me assess how my ideas were received. In a talk about MOOCs' risks and opportunities, someone immediately called me up on the risks of the opportunities, with a reference to Jaron Lanier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/chals14?src=hash"&gt;#chals14&lt;/a&gt; The social machine; I wonder what Jaron Lanier would say about that. Read "You are not a gadget" for a critical take in this.&lt;/p&gt;— Thommy Eriksson (@KuggenMedialab) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KuggenMedialab/status/514714933813338113"&gt;September 24, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now adding this to my reading list, since in fact he seems to talk a lot about mathematics too! It was also good to meet &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jorg.pareigis.se/"&gt;Jorg Pareigis&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;amp;q=%23ccourses&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;#ccourses participant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two quick mementos for myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have now traveled to the first 15 countries to constitute the European Union.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have never been before in such last minute trouble with computers: still private Google Slides locked out of my account, requiring Google two-factor authentication through a dead cell phone... Literally managed to get to the slides as I was walking to the stand.&lt;/li&gt;

MOOCs offer fantastic opportunities in this area. The XXIst century should also probably include scholarship of its own labor practices, or at least some concerted effort to stay afloat of developments in the profession. Asymmetric information can hurt badly in negociations. For this reason, it could be helpful to gather all &lt;strong&gt;Coursera Framework Agreements&lt;/strong&gt; that have landed on the internet (so far) in one place. Those agreements bind the university administration and Coursera, and package within them the actual contract to be signed later by the instructor (and guests), both with the administration and with Coursera. On top, any user of Coursera requires an account which is bound by its own Terms of Service &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/coursera-contracts-of-stony-brook-roma-unc-colorado-kentucky-michigan-utoronto-ucsc.html#id2" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By simply googling around (mostly for &lt;em&gt;Coursera Framework Agreement&lt;/em&gt;), I was able to find the following eight contracts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-Colorado.pdf"&gt;U Colorado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-Kentucky.pdf"&gt;U Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-Michigan.pdf"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-Roma.pdf"&gt;University of Roma (Sapienza)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-Stony_Brook.pdf"&gt;University of Stony Brook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-UCSC.pdf"&gt;UC Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-UNC.pdf"&gt;University of North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-UToronto.pdf"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all of those are signed, some are just preliminary and might not match the final version.
Some of those were originally obtained through Freedom of Information requests, while others were obviously misplaced. Some seem to have been removed from the web since, so I put them back here. &lt;strong&gt;The more interesting aspects here are the subtle variations between these contracts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you have one that you want to share, feel free to send it to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also include the following &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-UNC-CDA.pdf"&gt;Course Development Agreement&lt;/a&gt; for UNC. This contract is packaged within the Framework Agreement, and one is signed for each course at UNC, according to the CFA. It is relatively short, but refers to external guidelines located on the Coursera Partner Portal (i.e. online, inaccessible without an account with different permissions than a regular student account).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It includes the rollout policy for a particular course: 1.d.i and 1.d.ii dictate that the content should be uploaded one month ahead of the course start for the first week of content, and two weeks ahead for the second week, but "&lt;em&gt;[these] will not apply to the University Courses beginning in the Fall of 2013 if the achievement of these requirements is not practical or not feasible&lt;/em&gt;". UNC &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gazette.unc.edu/2013/02/26/unc-to-offer-moocs-with-coursera/"&gt;joined Coursera&lt;/a&gt; on February 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDA also includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="5"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course reusability&lt;/strong&gt;: Ensuring that the content can be easily reused in &lt;strong&gt;subsequent offerings of the course for which the instructor might not be involved&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a.&lt;/strong&gt; Avoiding references to particular dates in lecture videos (e.g., "The homework will be due next Monday, March 4" or "It’s a beautiful summer day today");&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b.&lt;/strong&gt; After the first offering of the course, &lt;strong&gt;systematically editing/removing references to dates and episodes that are specific to the first offering of the course&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., an announcement about correcting a typo on the final exam, or about extending due dates because of Hurricane Sandy), as well as references to activities for which instructor involvement is necessary (e.g., "We hope to see you at the next live Google+ Hangout").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—Coursera Development Agreement, to be signed by Coursera instructors at UNC (emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read through quite a lot of this, so if you have any question feel free to ask!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his recent post &lt;em&gt;You are not alone&lt;/em&gt; on the Salaita affair, Jonathan Rees &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://academeblog.org/2014/09/08/you-are-not-alone/"&gt;comments on the social media policies&lt;/a&gt; enacted at the Colorado, Kentucky and New Mexico state systems. He encourages other professors to speak up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few of us can be sure whether or not our campus is really the canary in the higher education coal mine. However, better mine safety everywhere eventually benefits everyone with a pick and shovel. The more we professors talk to each other, both on social media and off, the better off we’ll all be when bad ideas surface that may someday affect us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—Jonathan Rees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evocation of the canary is very beautiful. It resonates quite a bit: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html"&gt;ETH Zurich&lt;/a&gt; was after all founded to help the Swiss develop their own railway systems. In any case, looking back at his writing, Rees has really dug in the Coursera &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/dear-superprofessors-your-labor-has-value/"&gt;labor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/09/03/unbundle-yourself/"&gt;practices&lt;/a&gt;. This seems like a good opportunity to continue my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-i.html"&gt;edtech policies series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some googling, one can easily find the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.colorado.edu/bfa/INITIATIVES/CourseraK2013.pdf"&gt;Coursera Framework Agreement&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;em&gt;Coursera Inc., a Delaware corporation [..] and the Board of Regents of the University of Colorado [..] for the benefit of the University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../colorado-google.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/colorado-google.jpg" style="width: 545.0px; height: 123.0px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independently of any stereotype that as an academic &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/the-academic-social-machine-part-I.html"&gt;I hate capitalism&lt;/a&gt;, another stereotype could be that I also quite like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/paul-olivier-dehaye/insane-travel-insurance-policy/228313430077"&gt;to read contracts&lt;/a&gt;. Of course this one makes for a particularly interesting read: it is supposed to hint at how MOOCs will be sustainable for the UC system and how Coursera, Inc. will outlast its &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coursera"&gt;85M dollars "gifts" from venture capital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract details the various rights and obligations of the parties involved, the different Coursera monetization strategies (ten instead of the eight like in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/400864/coursera-fully-executed-agreement.pdf"&gt;2012 Michigan contract&lt;/a&gt;), the Course Acceptance Procedures, the responsibility of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/72903326640/introducing-the-2014-rotation-of-courseras-university"&gt;University Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt; when things go wrong, etc. Of particular interest to me is how it already packages in Exhibit G-1 the relationship between an instructor and the university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also includes the following gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hereby release, discharge, and promise not to sue Company and its affiliates, successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, demands, costs and/or causes of actions of any nature arising out of or in connection with the exercise of any rights herein granted, including, without limitation, any claim for infringement, right of publicity, libel, slander, defamation, moral rights, invasion of privacy or violation of any other rights relating to any Content I upload, share or otherwise provide in connection with use of the Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—Exhibit G-1, Form of Agreement for Instructors and Guest Presenters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, IANAL but once the instructor signs this, s/he is giving free pass to Coursera for any libel, slander, defamation, invasion of privacy etc against her/himself. I don't know the backstory on how the faculty at Colorado accepted this, but would be very interested. At UCSC, the collective bargaining chapter has on the other hand been &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ucscfa.org/2013/06/scfas-ongoing-discussion-concerning-ucscs-contract-with-coursera/"&gt;very critical&lt;/a&gt;, as has been discussed in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-i.html"&gt;part I&lt;/a&gt; of this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rees' words on this are very apt, to his credit a year ago already:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point you have to realize that you do not work in a vacuum. Teaching a MOOC or not teaching a MOOC, speaking out in favor of them or remaining silent – these things all have an effect on the rest of your profession. You can’t just declare that MOOCs are the future and let the chips fall where they may. You have the ability to influence what kind of future we’ll all face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—Jonathan Rees (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/dear-superprofessors-your-labor-has-value/"&gt;Labor Day 2013&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we guess what XXIst century education might guarantee in terms of labor rights? Is there an online strike clause in any of them? All I could find is called &lt;em&gt;Force Majeure&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each party is excused from performance of this Agreement (other than for any payments due) and will not be liable for any delay in whole or in part caused by the occurrence of any contigency beyond the reasonable control of such Party. These contigencies include, without limitation, war, sabotage, insurrection, riot or other acts of civil disobedience, act of public enemy, failure or delay in transportation, act of government or any agency or subdivision thereof affecting the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, judicial action, &lt;strong&gt;labor dispute&lt;/strong&gt;, student disorders, accident, fire, explosion, flood, severe weather, natural disaster or other &lt;strong&gt;act of God&lt;/strong&gt;, shortage of labor, hardware failure, interruptions or &lt;strong&gt;failure of the Internet&lt;/strong&gt; or third-party network connections or incapacity of an instructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Force majeure&lt;/em&gt; clause 19.6 of University of Colorado Boulder contract (emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if those risks are sorted in any way, but can't help but notice that &lt;em&gt;act of God&lt;/em&gt; sits right between
&lt;em&gt;labor dispute&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;failure of the Internet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently Rees has a show on the road. The title is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/category/academia/aaup/"&gt;Educational Technology, Budgetary Priorities and Academic Freedom&lt;/a&gt;. Should be good.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>coursera</category><category>crowdsourcing</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-ii.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2014 21:16:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Learning, working and ?</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/learning-working-and.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of my recent thoughts have turned around issues of crowdsourcing and online education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../worklearn.jpg" class="align-right" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/worklearn.jpg" style="width: 346.4px; height: 85.6px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my co-authors (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hci.uni-hannover.de/people/markus"&gt;Markus Krause&lt;/a&gt;) is co-organising a workshop on that topic, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.worklearn.org/"&gt;WorkLearn 2014&lt;/a&gt;. It will take place in Pittsburgh November 2-4, as part of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.humancomputation.com/2014/"&gt;Human Computation conference HCOMP2014&lt;/a&gt;. Human Computation is another expression interchangeable for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/social-teaching-machines.html"&gt;social machine&lt;/a&gt;, although it has different connotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stated motivation of the workshop is very ambitious:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online education and crowdsourcing communities are addressing similar problems in educating, motivating and evaluating students and workers. The online learning community succeeds in increasing the supply side of the cognitively skilled labor market, and the crowdsourcing at scale community creates a larger marketplace for cognitively skilled work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linking online platforms for crowd work with platforms for MOOCs has the potential to: provide knowledge and training at a massive scale to contributors; collect data that identify expert skills; engage contributors in simultaneously working and learning in a social environment; and organize large communities around online courses on specific topics. These all provide new opportunities to support and deploy sophisticated algorithms for crowd learning and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most successful example in this direction is of course &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://duolingo.com"&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;, which helps translate the web while using volunteer labor by language learners. If one omits the learning, the strategy there is not that different from the strategy used by my Coursera coworker &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/bernstein"&gt;Abraham Bernstein&lt;/a&gt; to translate books using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk"&gt;Amazon Mechanical Turk&lt;/a&gt;, and indeed part of his efforts aim to design effective tools to program those social machines (with the programming language CrowdLang).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;embed&gt;&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/emCABRV2cUA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have always had some qualms about the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://florianschmidt.co/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/"&gt;ethics of crowdsourcing&lt;/a&gt;, even though it can clearly be used for good: the prototypical success story is in the work of Ushahidi during the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ushahidi.com/blog/2012/01/12/haiti-and-the-power-of-crowdsourcing/"&gt;2010 Haiti earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. I was thus very happy to see over Labor Day 2014 that Michael Bernstein from Stanford announced &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://crowdresearch.org/blog/?p=9039"&gt;guidelines for academic requesters on Amazon Mechanical Turk&lt;/a&gt;. He explains the rationale for this (a Turker is a worker on a crowdsourcing platform):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
An IRB-approved researcher experimented on the [crowdsourcing] platform unannounced. The result was Turker confusion, strife, and wasted time, in a system where time is what it takes to make ends meet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guidelines were themselves crowdsourced, designed together with the Turkers (it's only natural!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, over the summer, there was a huge controversy over the iffy ethics of social platforms experimentation. This is due to the release at the very end of June 2014 of a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/06/29/facebook-doesnt-understand-the-fuss-about-its-emotion-manipulation-study/"&gt;Facebook experiment on its users&lt;/a&gt; (don't miss the Cornell IRB flowchart there). There are a ton of links about this, but the best is probably the account by Mary L. Gray of an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://marylgray.org/?page_id=203"&gt;ethics panel that took place at the Microsoft Research Faculty Summit&lt;/a&gt; (and unfortunately was published with much delay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this should give serious pause to any educator. One can see lots of fields suddenly getting much too close, with very different or inexistent values. Online learners, just as Turkers, are vulnerable. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2014/06/the-ethics-of-digital-scholarship.html"&gt;Martin Weller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2014/01/13/the-vulnerability-of-learning/"&gt;George Siemens&lt;/a&gt; have recently insisted on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Anyone wants to submit a position paper (2 pages) on the topic? Any of my co-learners in MOOCs would like to see what we can do? We could, well... crowdsource it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(of course, this was due yesterday: official deadline is "September")&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>connected_course</category><category>coursera</category><category>crowdsourcing</category><category>duolingo</category><category>ethics</category><category>t509massive</category><category>whyopen</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/learning-working-and.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2014 00:17:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Edtech policies (part I)</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-i.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In a previous post, I talked about some of the problems associated with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/dont-be-evil-or-how-i-learned-to-behave-like-a-startup-and-love-the-data.html"&gt;data collection with no clear purpose&lt;/a&gt;. In this one, I want to compare two of the big players in edtech on a narrow point, that of comment posts and their associated privacy. This is partly done in response to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/funnymonkey"&gt;Bill Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;'s posts on edtech privacy policies, but also as a concerned parent looking a bit far out in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 26th Google held an I/O developer conference. I was hoping, like many, some kind of announcement about &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mooc.org"&gt;mooc.org&lt;/a&gt;. Not much was said on that, but it was still an instructive watch of the efforts of Google in the MOOC space. I was particularly struck by a comment of Julia Wilkowski (leader in their MOOC project) following a question from the audience. The comment is at 28:35, if it does not play for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;p&gt;She informs us that no sophisticated analysis has been performed thus far on the Google MOOC forum posts. There are apparently two reasons: it is complicated, and they are required to delete all the posts after 60 days to comply with their privacy policy. Indeed, Google MOOCs fall under the global umbrella of the Google Privacy Policy, which seems to uniformly apply to all their products. The main reason for this number seems to be technical rather than anything else (the backup system is presumably very complex, extending all the way to physical tapes), since I couldn't find a reference to it in the Google Privacy Policy (and neither could other people, if you, well, google it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tad later, Peter Norvig talks about classifiers (similar to those used in the recent Facebook experiment that would make the news 3 or 4 days later), for instance to help determine when a student might be confused, a classic trick in intelligent tutoring systems. He immediately reminds us though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there still are a lot of privacy issues involved in what [..] information can you keep, how much can you tie the identity in the forum to the identity of the student, can you tie that to their identity someplace else, and the field as a whole has to come to grips with the privacy issues so we can share and learn what we want without violating privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coursera is another big player in the market, with a rather different approach. In their Terms of Service and Privacy policy, one can find the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../forum-reuse.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/forum-reuse.jpg" style="width: 868.0px; height: 112.0px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most remarkable sentence here is: &lt;strong&gt;We also reserve the right to reuse Forum posts containing Personally Identifiable Information in future versions of the course we offer, and to enhance further course offerings.&lt;/strong&gt; This sentence is very puzzling to me. What does it mean? The only logical explanation I can offer is that Coursera plans to repopulate forums in later iterations of the course with posts from a previous run, presumably one where there was more emphasis on moderating the course. Ask a dumb question once, and it will be asked again on repeat, &lt;strong&gt;in your name&lt;/strong&gt;, in contexts you don't necessarily know. Share a bit too much of your great idea for a startup, in a context where you feel confortable, well, too bad: it might be reshared again, even if you delete your post at the end of a course (many MOOC students have the feeble illusion that this protects their intellectual property).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Terms of Service also include the following, which is classically &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.ch/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=%22Neither+the+User+Content+(as+defined+below)+on+these+Sites%2C+nor+any+links+to+other+websites%2C+are+screened%2C+moderated%2C+approved%2C+reviewed+or+endorsed%22&amp;amp;start=0"&gt;present in many platform disclaimers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../forum-disclaimer.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/forum-disclaimer.jpg" style="width: 863.0px; height: 156.0px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coursera Terms of Service include numerous such disturbing clauses, as detailed in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.craigbutosi.ca/blog/coursera-or-socrates-was-not-a-content-provider-the-university-of-toronto-and-coursera-agreement"&gt;this wonderful post&lt;/a&gt; from August 2012. That post is a &lt;strong&gt;very highly recommended read&lt;/strong&gt;, since it details issues of free speech and academic freedom, a hot button those days. It also includes the following gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is crucial that we pay close attention to the fine print, something unfortunately overshadowed by the immediacy and novelty of Web 2.0 solutions and the latest trends in brand management techniques.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only recommend this approach, but it has to be moderated by a quote given earlier in the piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because Coursera mediates between instructor/university and user/student communication, we are dealing with at least four major relationships: user-Coursera, Coursera-instructor/university, user-Coursera-instructor/university, and vice versa. I am mainly focusing on the user-Coursera relation (terms of use and privacy policy), but it should be noted that these are really only separable at the analytical level. In reality, all of these relations are in play at any given time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves many unanswered questions, which are not easy to address. It requires access to other contracts, between the instructor, the university and Coursera itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one such contract between a university and Coursera has been discussed on a wide scale, the contract given to the University of Michigan. It was the object of a 2012 Chronicle of Higher Education article (an antiquity in the domain of MOOCs), and is based on a Freedom of Information request for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://chronicle.com/article/Document-Examine-the-U-of/133063/"&gt;University of Michigan contracts&lt;/a&gt;.
More recently, the UCSC Faculty Union has entered negociations with Coursera, that are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ucscfa.org/2013/06/scfas-ongoing-discussion-concerning-ucscs-contract-with-coursera/"&gt;detailed on its blog&lt;/a&gt;. From the outside, these negociations seem very one-sided and highlight differences with the University of Michigan contract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the Michigan contract, the instructor grants to COURSERA various rights FOR THE DURATION SUCH CONTENT IS OFFERED THROUGH THE PLATFORM (i.e., very limited transfer  of rights).  In our contract, in contrast, the rights are granted TO THE UNIVERSITY and this appears to be irrevocable and not connected to the hosting of the course on the Coursera  platform.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the balance of the Coursera contract shifts towards the instructor at the University of Michigan, compared to at UCSC. In the latest Shangai rankings (for the little they are worth), Michigan was ranked 22nd while UCSC was 93rd. Bear in mind that Michigan joined earlier, which might also affect this complex bargaining equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other contracts have been put online, intentionally or not, and can be found by googling titles etc. I found eight in total, which can serve as evidence of subtle shifts of the Coursera strategy, and also segmentation according to the characteristics of the universities involved (European vs. American, public vs. private, etc). Since many of those contracts are locked under Non Disclosure Agreements, and this has already become a union issue elsewhere, I can only encourage other academics to push for openness of those contracts at their own institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For a cool application of machine learning to the process of teaching, look also at the video around the 4:30 mark. Google seems to focus there on content rather than users, and to extract values from the student contributions rather than their private data. They effectively intend to crowdsource smarter compilers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I want to thank Ignacio Despujol Zabala for letting me know about this Google I/O session.)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>coursera</category><category>edtech</category><category>google</category><category>privacy</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-i.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2014 10:23:58 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
