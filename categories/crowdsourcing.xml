&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just listened to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/RitchinBtfInterview"&gt;an audio interview&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Jonathan Worth for his &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://phonar.org.uk"&gt;photography course #phonar&lt;/a&gt;, back in 2013. The interviewee is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Ritchin"&gt;Fred Ritchin&lt;/a&gt;, a journalist, professor and author. Originally I was attracted to the interview because of a question asked by Ritchin during a #ccourses hangout about trust. He essentially asked how an entire profession (journalism) could rebuild trust with its audience once it was lost. It felt as if he was hoping educators could help give an answer that is eluding his profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have talked &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/building-trust-in-massiveteaching-through-visuals.html"&gt;before on this blog&lt;/a&gt; of the parallels I see in Worth's approach in #phonar and mine with MOOC teaching. It looks like Ritchin can help explore these parallels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older paradigm for photojournalists was to simply record events, with the hope—and frequently the expectation—that people and their governments would be moved to respond to the injustices pictured, as witnessed by the impact of certain images during the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War. Given evolving media and political climates, however, including the billions of images now available online from all kinds of sources, the purpose and effectiveness of media, in particular of visual journalism, has been called into question. Bending the Frame, by author and critic Fred Ritchin, addresses the new and emerging potentials for visual media to impact society. Also encompassing online efforts, uses of video, and a diverse range of books and exhibitions, this volume aims for as wide-ranging and far-reaching a discussion as possible, asking the critical question: how can images promote new thinking and make a difference in the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://aperture.org/shop/books/bending-the-frame-fred-ritchin-books#sthash.JKE7mMEM.dpuf"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bending the Frame: Photojournalism, Documentary, and the Citizen&lt;/em&gt;, Fred Ritchin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, digital photography and the web have led to a complete rethink of the role of professional photographers in society, and a struggle now to find their relevance in the wider world. The interview is at times a litany of missed opportunities for the New York Times. Ritchin recalls experiments conducted by the editorial side of the New York Times, playing with new multimedia options. This was in 1994, and was instigated by the business side of the journal, actually, full of hope that this could lead to new revenues. Immediately of course this was squashed when all newspapers started making their content freely available on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ritchin's response then was to use this new media to show a new kind of story: instead of showing war, he would show peace. His test case was Bosnia, where he tried to construct a nonlinear narrative around the experience of a photojournalist arriving there, and convey some of the disorientation  and confusion of the fallout of an ethnic war. In constructing this narrative, he had to put the photographer back in the center, because of the need for multiple links between elements in different photographs. This was completely new territory for anyone: even the idea of clicking on an image had to be explained to the readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
It opened up the idea of instead of the New York Times and the photographer telling you what is going on, you as a reader have to become a collaborator with them to figure out what is going on, because in fact the photographer does not really know what is going on. The New York Times does not really know what is going on. We are all piecing it together. We all have our own experiences and we could apply our own experiences to the situation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work was submitted at the time for a Pulitzer price in public service, but immediately rejected because it wasn't on paper. He says it took many years "for institutions to investigate the new possibilities of digital, of telling stories differently, of understanding the world differently." He recalls his own thinking back then, that deviated sharply from this insitutional chokehold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
If this is a revolution in media, we have to think in revolutionary ways, we can't just do what we were doing before. And photography is very good at being reactive. It reacts well to situations. There is a war, we photograph it. Spectacular imagery. But I prefer a pro-active photography, one that says "We don't want a war to happen". How can we make images prevent war? Or minimize it. How can we minimize global warming? How can we do things before the bad stuff happens?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the institutions lost: there was a "collapse of the mainstream, which puts the marginal in the centre, as a new practice or rather an old pratice, but one we didn't want to acknowledge before." Finally, the old institutions have had to acknowledge that all those experimental ideas were going in the right direction. But in the twenty years interval, they have suffered drastically from the intrusion of many new players on their turf, leading to his original question about trust. How do bona fide journalist now regain the trust of the general public, in a new landscape where their credentials are often ignored? Ritchin himelf introduces some clues: through a reversal of roles, between the amateur embedded in a community, and the professional outsider coming to report about the community. In 2013, he sees the "integration of both as the greatest challenge in journalism right now".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is fascinating to me, and I can see many parallels with MOOCs and the institutional meddling at the frontline of online education. Photojournalism itself was born on the frontlines, with its founding fathers in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_Photos"&gt;Magnum agency&lt;/a&gt;, a cooperative of photojournalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
They didn't discuss photography in the founding years. They discussed the world. They were happy to have survived World War II. [..] They were very political. They were interested in the future of people. It wasn't the future of photography. They were interested in the future of people. And I appreciated that, because I think the point of photography is not to celebrate itself but the point of photography is to be useful in the world, to try to get us to a better place. And that's the way they were working. To me that's what the original spirit of Magnum was.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we need a cooperative of MOOC educators?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Ritchin also talks about &lt;em&gt;horseless carriages&lt;/em&gt;, and the technological determinism that prevents us to see unintended consequences of inventions such as digital photography. And Magnum has built its &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/categories/social_machine.html"&gt;own social machine&lt;/a&gt; to crowdsource the metadata tagging of its archive, which has led to the find of a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2011/06/crowdsourcing-and-discovery-of-hidden.html"&gt;hidden treasure&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>connected_course</category><category>crowdsourcing</category><category>mooc</category><category>phonar</category><category>social_machine</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/moocs-journalism-and-digital-disruption.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2014 23:39:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>What I am doing with MOOCs and why (June 2nd)</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/what-i-am-doing-with-moocs-and-why-june-2nd.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk on July 2nd about MOOCs. The goal was to explain to interested individuals the different potential futures of MOOCs, informed with the perspective of a mathematician. A lot of what I say is undoubtedly naive, but this was four months ago, an eternity in the MOOC world. And in any case I prefer to be attacked for things I said in a talk setting at my own institution to colleagues rather than things I {reportedly, supposedly} said to students in a closed setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of my talk was &lt;em&gt;What I am doing with MOOCs and why&lt;/em&gt; (apologies for bad sound, one hour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe width="425" height="344" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/NCLHWaYxMyM?rel=0&amp;amp;hd=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gave this talk in anticipation of a conference co-organised the next day with Stanford in Zurich, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://user.math.uzh.ch/dehaye/edx_meeting.html"&gt;the first OpenEdX conference&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.openedx.org"&gt;OpenEdX&lt;/a&gt; is the platform that powers &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.edx.org"&gt;edx.org&lt;/a&gt;. This conference has now become a regular event, with the next one on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://con.openedx.org/"&gt;Harvard campus&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the conference, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Sites-powered-by-Open-edX/93583d8f92cf692766180eca247960294114af7a"&gt;24 separate installation sites were listed&lt;/a&gt; on the relevant Github pages, almost all of them in English. Four months later, the project now counts &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Sites-powered-by-Open-edX"&gt;47 sites&lt;/a&gt; all over the world, a significant progress! It also now has &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/List-of-XBlocks"&gt;23 different publicly available Xblocks&lt;/a&gt;, which are extensions of OpenEdX to customise it to particular needs (only a couple had been released back then).
As I explain this in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://collab.switch.ch/p26oy3gl9aj/?launcher=false&amp;amp;fcsContent=true&amp;amp;pbMode=normal"&gt;first 4 minutes of this video&lt;/a&gt;, privacy issues are very significant in Switzerland, Europe, Quebec and the United States and motivated me to convene the workshop. This comes right after the Snowden scandals, and it is very hard for large actors outside the USA to trust a service like Amazon Web Services. A positive outcome was that it helped crystallise a need for separate service vendors, which edX then helped to get started. There are now eight different &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/List-of-Open-edX-service-providers"&gt;commercial vendors&lt;/a&gt;, happily customising the platform to suit new needs.  The conference also helped a lot of local startups/nonprofits get a jump start in the MOOC space, such as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.blue-planet-life.org/"&gt;Blue Planet Life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I was a bit disappointed however in the answer he gave to a question I asked at the end of his talk. It really did seem like noone had yet practically considered how MOOCs might change entire disciplines for research, or create new ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>coursera</category><category>crowdsourcing</category><category>gsiemens</category><category>mooc</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/what-i-am-doing-with-moocs-and-why-june-2nd.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2014 12:41:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Edtech policies (part II)</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-ii.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;For the first post in my series on edtech privacy policies, terms of service and contracts, click &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-i.rst"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his recent post &lt;em&gt;You are not alone&lt;/em&gt; on the Salaita affair, Jonathan Rees &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://academeblog.org/2014/09/08/you-are-not-alone/"&gt;comments on the social media policies&lt;/a&gt; enacted at the Colorado, Kentucky and New Mexico state systems. He encourages other professors to speak up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few of us can be sure whether or not our campus is really the canary in the higher education coal mine. However, better mine safety everywhere eventually benefits everyone with a pick and shovel. The more we professors talk to each other, both on social media and off, the better off we’ll all be when bad ideas surface that may someday affect us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—Jonathan Rees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evocation of the canary is very beautiful. It resonates quite a bit: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html"&gt;ETH Zurich&lt;/a&gt; was after all founded to help the Swiss develop their own railway systems. In any case, looking back at his writing, Rees has really dug in the Coursera &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/dear-superprofessors-your-labor-has-value/"&gt;labor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/09/03/unbundle-yourself/"&gt;practices&lt;/a&gt;. This seems like a good opportunity to continue my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-i.html"&gt;edtech policies series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some googling, one can easily find the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.colorado.edu/bfa/INITIATIVES/CourseraK2013.pdf"&gt;Coursera Framework Agreement&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;em&gt;Coursera Inc., a Delaware corporation [..] and the Board of Regents of the University of Colorado [..] for the benefit of the University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../colorado-google.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/colorado-google.jpg" style="width: 545.0px; height: 123.0px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independently of any stereotype that as an academic &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/the-academic-social-machine-part-I.html"&gt;I hate capitalism&lt;/a&gt;, another stereotype could be that I also quite like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/paul-olivier-dehaye/insane-travel-insurance-policy/228313430077"&gt;to read contracts&lt;/a&gt;. Of course this one makes for a particularly interesting read: it is supposed to hint at how MOOCs will be sustainable for the UC system and how Coursera, Inc. will outlast its &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coursera"&gt;85M dollars "gifts" from venture capital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract details the various rights and obligations of the parties involved, the different Coursera monetization strategies (ten instead of the eight like in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/400864/coursera-fully-executed-agreement.pdf"&gt;2012 Michigan contract&lt;/a&gt;), the Course Acceptance Procedures, the responsibility of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/72903326640/introducing-the-2014-rotation-of-courseras-university"&gt;University Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt; when things go wrong, etc. Of particular interest to me is how it already packages in Exhibit G-1 the relationship between an instructor and the university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also includes the following gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hereby release, discharge, and promise not to sue Company and its affiliates, successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, demands, costs and/or causes of actions of any nature arising out of or in connection with the exercise of any rights herein granted, including, without limitation, any claim for infringement, right of publicity, libel, slander, defamation, moral rights, invasion of privacy or violation of any other rights relating to any Content I upload, share or otherwise provide in connection with use of the Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—Exhibit G-1, Form of Agreement for Instructors and Guest Presenters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, IANAL but once the instructor signs this, s/he is giving free pass to Coursera for any libel, slander, defamation, invasion of privacy etc against her/himself. I don't know the backstory on how the faculty at Colorado accepted this, but would be very interested. At UCSC, the collective bargaining chapter has on the other hand been &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ucscfa.org/2013/06/scfas-ongoing-discussion-concerning-ucscs-contract-with-coursera/"&gt;very critical&lt;/a&gt;, as has been discussed in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-i.html"&gt;part I&lt;/a&gt; of this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rees' words on this are very apt, to his credit a year ago already:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point you have to realize that you do not work in a vacuum. Teaching a MOOC or not teaching a MOOC, speaking out in favor of them or remaining silent – these things all have an effect on the rest of your profession. You can’t just declare that MOOCs are the future and let the chips fall where they may. You have the ability to influence what kind of future we’ll all face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—Jonathan Rees (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/dear-superprofessors-your-labor-has-value/"&gt;Labor Day 2013&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we guess what XXIst century education might guarantee in terms of labor rights? Is there an online strike clause in any of them? All I could find is called &lt;em&gt;Force Majeure&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each party is excused from performance of this Agreement (other than for any payments due) and will not be liable for any delay in whole or in part caused by the occurrence of any contigency beyond the reasonable control of such Party. These contigencies include, without limitation, war, sabotage, insurrection, riot or other acts of civil disobedience, act of public enemy, failure or delay in transportation, act of government or any agency or subdivision thereof affecting the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, judicial action, &lt;strong&gt;labor dispute&lt;/strong&gt;, student disorders, accident, fire, explosion, flood, severe weather, natural disaster or other &lt;strong&gt;act of God&lt;/strong&gt;, shortage of labor, hardware failure, interruptions or &lt;strong&gt;failure of the Internet&lt;/strong&gt; or third-party network connections or incapacity of an instructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Force majeure&lt;/em&gt; clause 19.6 of University of Colorado Boulder contract (emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if those risks are sorted in any way, but can't help but notice that &lt;em&gt;act of God&lt;/em&gt; sits right between
&lt;em&gt;labor dispute&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;failure of the Internet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently Rees has a show on the road. The title is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/category/academia/aaup/"&gt;Educational Technology, Budgetary Priorities and Academic Freedom&lt;/a&gt;. Should be good.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>coursera</category><category>crowdsourcing</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-ii.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2014 21:16:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Learning, working and ?</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/learning-working-and.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of my recent thoughts have turned around issues of crowdsourcing and online education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../worklearn.jpg" class="align-right" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/worklearn.jpg" style="width: 346.4px; height: 85.6px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my co-authors (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hci.uni-hannover.de/people/markus"&gt;Markus Krause&lt;/a&gt;) is co-organising a workshop on that topic, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.worklearn.org/"&gt;WorkLearn 2014&lt;/a&gt;. It will take place in Pittsburgh November 2-4, as part of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.humancomputation.com/2014/"&gt;Human Computation conference HCOMP2014&lt;/a&gt;. Human Computation is another expression interchangeable for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/social-teaching-machines.html"&gt;social machine&lt;/a&gt;, although it has different connotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stated motivation of the workshop is very ambitious:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online education and crowdsourcing communities are addressing similar problems in educating, motivating and evaluating students and workers. The online learning community succeeds in increasing the supply side of the cognitively skilled labor market, and the crowdsourcing at scale community creates a larger marketplace for cognitively skilled work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linking online platforms for crowd work with platforms for MOOCs has the potential to: provide knowledge and training at a massive scale to contributors; collect data that identify expert skills; engage contributors in simultaneously working and learning in a social environment; and organize large communities around online courses on specific topics. These all provide new opportunities to support and deploy sophisticated algorithms for crowd learning and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most successful example in this direction is of course &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://duolingo.com"&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;, which helps translate the web while using volunteer labor by language learners. If one omits the learning, the strategy there is not that different from the strategy used by my Coursera coworker &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/bernstein"&gt;Abraham Bernstein&lt;/a&gt; to translate books using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk"&gt;Amazon Mechanical Turk&lt;/a&gt;, and indeed part of his efforts aim to design effective tools to program those social machines (with the programming language CrowdLang).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have always had some qualms about the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://florianschmidt.co/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/"&gt;ethics of crowdsourcing&lt;/a&gt;, even though it can clearly be used for good: the prototypical success story is in the work of Ushahidi during the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ushahidi.com/blog/2012/01/12/haiti-and-the-power-of-crowdsourcing/"&gt;2010 Haiti earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. I was thus very happy to see over Labor Day 2014 that Michael Bernstein from Stanford announced &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://crowdresearch.org/blog/?p=9039"&gt;guidelines for academic requesters on Amazon Mechanical Turk&lt;/a&gt;. He explains the rationale for this (a Turker is a worker on a crowdsourcing platform):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
An IRB-approved researcher experimented on the [crowdsourcing] platform unannounced. The result was Turker confusion, strife, and wasted time, in a system where time is what it takes to make ends meet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guidelines were themselves crowdsourced, designed together with the Turkers (it's only natural!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, over the summer, there was a huge controversy over the iffy ethics of social platforms experimentation. This is due to the release at the very end of June 2014 of a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/06/29/facebook-doesnt-understand-the-fuss-about-its-emotion-manipulation-study/"&gt;Facebook experiment on its users&lt;/a&gt; (don't miss the Cornell IRB flowchart there). There are a ton of links about this, but the best is probably the account by Mary L. Gray of an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://marylgray.org/?page_id=203"&gt;ethics panel that took place at the Microsoft Research Faculty Summit&lt;/a&gt; (and unfortunately was published with much delay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this should give serious pause to any educator. One can see lots of fields suddenly getting much too close, with very different or inexistent values. Online learners, just as Turkers, are vulnerable. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2014/06/the-ethics-of-digital-scholarship.html"&gt;Martin Weller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2014/01/13/the-vulnerability-of-learning/"&gt;George Siemens&lt;/a&gt; have recently insisted on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Anyone wants to submit a position paper (2 pages) on the topic? Any of my co-learners in MOOCs would like to see what we can do? We could, well... crowdsource it...&lt;/p&gt;

Ten years is the estimate. Combined with car sharing, they will revolutionise our cities and make them much more efficient and livable. They should bring about umitigated good to our society. Yet they still come with ethical challenges, usually categorized as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem"&gt;trolley problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wired just published an article called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/2014/08/heres-a-terrible-idea-robot-cars-with-adjustable-ethics-settings/"&gt;Here's a Terrible Idea: Robot Cars With Adjustable Ethics Settings&lt;/a&gt;, outlining the ethical issues involved in substituting human drivers with robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In freak accidents, computers would have to take decisions such as &lt;strong&gt;killing one motorcyclist without a helmet vs. killing five pedestrians&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer raises many such dystopian choices: &lt;strong&gt;children vs elderly&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;us vs others&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;rich vs poor&lt;/strong&gt;, etc. He rightfully sees a liability for anyone having to program those decisions. In his opinion, any attempt by the car manufacturer to distantiate itself from lawsuits by offering variable ethical settings to the owner of the car would not decrease the liability of the car manufacturer, and therefore this remains an obstacle to rolling in a driverless car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The car company has another option, which is missed by the writer: absorb progressively the insurance business.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, it's clear that any level of indirection and legal tangling is helpful in freak legal confrontations to shield car manufacturer from legal responsibility towards private individuals. Secondly, the writer does not give enough credit to the creativity of engineers/lawyers/business types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Why wouldn't they be able to introduce one further level of indirection? The manufacturer could build a "car without a soul".&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car could offer full access proprietary APIs to its raw or slightly processed data, but require linking to an ethical core library before it would start. This ethical core would only be called upon if a future collision is detected, and asked to respond to the really tough questions (or it could be run on a loop validating any driving input). Who would take the liability of writing such a core? Insurance companies would seem like the natural candidate. In fact, this is a very natural extension of their business, litigating for the choices they have coldly programmed in rather than the mistakes made by their clients. It would also make sense to decentralise geographically this ethical core, since driving customs are bound to vary from country to country (think of these &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vd_OuqUAaI"&gt;comparatively safe Indian drivers&lt;/a&gt; or this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjrEQaG5jPM"&gt;Russian ninja&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is whether insurance companies would be willing to go along. They would certainly feel pressure to adapt to a world of driverless cars, but the brilliant move for the car company would be to promise increased efficiency and reach to the whole insurance industry (more clients), and act as a middleman. By encouraging collaboration between the insurance companies, ostensibly to help them save money on R&amp;amp;D, standardise good practice, exchange regulatory tips, etc, the car company would crowdsource the insurance industry to force itself into obsolescence. This would allow the car company to eventually provide the full product, once all the R&amp;amp;D costs of the fine tuning of the ethical core have been shouldered by the insurance companies. Note that this core would only be ethical in name, as it would have been exclusively fine tuned with cost efficiency in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assumes there is a car company that is sufficiently dominating the car industry to strong arm insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For other futuristic and "fun" questions on the transformation brought about by driverless cars, see the amazingly cold-blooded &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://fortune.com/2014/08/15/if-driverless-cars-save-lives-where-will-we-get-organs/"&gt;If driverless cars save lives, where will we get organs?&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
