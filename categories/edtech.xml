In this one, I want to compare two of the big players in edtech on a narrow point, that of comment posts and their associated privacy. This is partly done in response to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/funnymonkey"&gt;Bill Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;'s posts on edtech privacy policies, but also as a concerned parent looking a bit far out in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 26th Google held an I/O developer conference. I was hoping, like many, some kind of announcement about &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mooc.org"&gt;mooc.org&lt;/a&gt;. Not much was said on that, but it was still an instructive watch of the efforts of Google in the MOOC space. I was particularly struck by a comment of Julia Wilkowski (leader in their MOOC project) following a question from the audience. The comment is at 28:35, if it does not play for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;embed&gt;&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/YCUZ01yFtsM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;p&gt;She informs us that no sophisticated analysis has been performed thus far on the Google MOOC forum posts. There are apparently two reasons: it is complicated, and they are required to delete all the posts after 60 days to comply with their privacy policy. Indeed, Google MOOCs fall under the global umbrella of the Google Privacy Policy, which seems to uniformly apply to all their products. The main reason for this number seems to be technical rather than anything else (the backup system is presumably very complex, extending all the way to physical tapes), since I couldn't find a reference to it in the Google Privacy Policy (and neither could other people, if you, well, google it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tad later, Peter Norvig talks about classifiers (similar to those used in the recent Facebook experiment that would make the news 3 or 4 days later), for instance to help determine when a student might be confused, a classic trick in intelligent tutoring systems. He immediately reminds us though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there still are a lot of privacy issues involved in what [..] information can you keep, how much can you tie the identity in the forum to the identity of the student, can you tie that to their identity someplace else, and the field as a whole has to come to grips with the privacy issues so we can share and learn what we want without violating privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—Peter Norvig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coursera is another big player in the market, with a rather different approach. In their Terms of Service and Privacy policy, one can find the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../forum-reuse.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/forum-reuse.jpg" style="width: 868.0px; height: 112.0px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most remarkable sentence here is: &lt;strong&gt;We also reserve the right to reuse Forum posts containing Personally Identifiable Information in future versions of the course we offer, and to enhance further course offerings.&lt;/strong&gt; This sentence is very puzzling to me. What does it mean? The only logical explanation I can offer is that Coursera plans to repopulate forums in later iterations of the course with posts from a previous run, presumably one where there was more emphasis on moderating the course. Ask a dumb question once, and it will be asked again on repeat, in contexts you don't necessarily know. Share a bit too much of your great idea for a startup, in a context where you feel confortable, well, too bad: it might be reshared again, even if you delete your post at the end of a course (many MOOC students have the feeble illusion that this protects their intellectual property).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Terms of Service also include the following, which is classically &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.ch/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=%22Neither+the+User+Content+(as+defined+below)+on+these+Sites%2C+nor+any+links+to+other+websites%2C+are+screened%2C+moderated%2C+approved%2C+reviewed+or+endorsed%22&amp;amp;start=0"&gt;present in many platform disclaimers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../forum-disclaimer.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/forum-disclaimer.jpg" style="width: 863.0px; height: 156.0px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coursera Terms of Service include numerous such disturbing clauses, as detailed in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.craigbutosi.ca/blog/coursera-or-socrates-was-not-a-content-provider-the-university-of-toronto-and-coursera-agreement"&gt;this wonderful post&lt;/a&gt; from August 2012. That post is a &lt;strong&gt;very highly recommended read&lt;/strong&gt;, since it details issues of free speech and academic freedom, a hot button those days. It also includes the following gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is crucial that we pay close attention to the fine print, something unfortunately overshadowed by the immediacy and novelty of Web 2.0 solutions and the latest trends in brand management techniques.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only recommend this approach, but it has to be moderated by a quote given earlier in the piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because Coursera mediates between instructor/university and user/student communication, we are dealing with at least four major relationships: user-Coursera, Coursera-instructor/university, user-Coursera-instructor/university, and vice versa. I am mainly focusing on the user-Coursera relation (terms of use and privacy policy), but it should be noted that these are really only separable at the analytical level. In reality, all of these relations are in play at any given time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves many unanswered questions: answering them requires access to other contracts, between the instructor, the university and Coursera itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main agreement between a university and Coursera, has been discussed back in 2012 (antiquity in the domain of MOOCs) in a Chronicle of Higher Education article. It is based on a Freedom of Information request for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://chronicle.com/article/Document-Examine-the-U-of/133063/"&gt;University of Michigan contracts&lt;/a&gt;.
More recently, the UCSC Faculty Union has entered negociations (sort of) with Coursera, that are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ucscfa.org/2013/06/scfas-ongoing-discussion-concerning-ucscs-contract-with-coursera/"&gt;detailed on its blog&lt;/a&gt;. They specifically point out to differences with the University of Michigan contract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the Michigan contract, the instructor grants to COURSERA various rights FOR THE DURATION SUCH CONTENT IS OFFERED THROUGH THE PLATFORM (i.e., very limited transfer  of rights).  In our contract, in contrast, the rights are granted TO THE UNIVERSITY and this appears to be irrevocable and not connected to the hosting of the course on the Coursera  platform.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the balance of the Coursera contract shifts towards the instructor at the University of Michigan, compared to at UCSC. In the latest Shangai rankings (for the little they are worth), Michigan was ranked 22nd while UCSC was 93rd. Bear in mind that Michigan joined earlier, which might also affect this complex bargaining equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other contracts have been put online, intentionally or not, and can be found by googling titles etc. I found eight in total, which can serve as evidence of subtle shifts of the Coursera strategy, and also segmentation according to the characteristics of the universities involved (European vs. American, public vs. private, etc). Since many of those contracts are locked under Non Disclosure Agreements, and this has already become a union issue elsewhere, I can only encourage other academics to push for openness of those contracts at their own institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For a cool application of machine learning to the process of teaching, look also at the video around the 4:30 mark. Google seems to focus there on content rather than users there, and to extract values from the student contributions rather than their private data. They effectively intend to crowdsource smarter compilers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I want to thank Ignacio Despujol Zabala for letting me know about Google I/O.)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>coursera</category><category>edtech</category><category>google</category><category>privacy</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-i.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2014 10:23:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>(Social) teaching machines</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/social-teaching-machines.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I want to take the opportunity of the recent talk by Audrey Watters on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/09/03/monsters-altc2014/"&gt;Ed-Tech's Monsters&lt;/a&gt; to share some of my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her talk, Watters physically bases herself at Bletchley Park, a place of invention, ingenuity and deceit that greatly contributed to the Allies' war effort and incidentally the evolution of computing. She then steps back in time to Ludd and his followers, who rebelled against the introduction of machinery in their work. She then segways into the Frankenstein story of a creation abandoned by its master and finally draws parallels with the situation in ed tech today and the "promises" of teaching machines. This was an impossibly bad and short summary of a very good talk, so I would highly recommend to any reader lost here to go read the original. After doing that, please come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="900" height="600" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/6qwZm56UadE?rel=0&amp;amp;hd=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;During World War II, cryptographers worked at Bletchley Park to decipher German and Japanese secret messages. These were encoded by various versions of a machine called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine"&gt;Enigma&lt;/a&gt;, a typewriter wired with multiple electrical contacts that constantly shuffled letters around. It is really a quite dumb but very messy and obfuscated process, with one useful property: at any stage it created an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)"&gt;involution&lt;/a&gt;, so one can use the same machine to both encrypt and decrypt. You can see little Millie demonstrating this in the video above (shot in September 2013 by yours truly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../bombe-front.jpg" class="align-right" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/bombe-front.jpg" style="width: 365.04px; height: 273.6px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To attack the ciphered messages, the cryptologists at Bletchley Park did not build full on computers, but instead  machines that could simulate many Enigmas in parallel (36 Enigmas per &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe"&gt;Turing Bombe&lt;/a&gt;). These also had extra wiring which encoded additional properties of the Enigma protocol. On any given day, around 200 of these machines were used to recover the common settings for all the encrypted messages sent that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has always fascinated me with Blecthley Park is the &lt;strong&gt;subtle interplay between humans and the machines&lt;/strong&gt;. While the heavy computations were done by those Bombes, the British did not seek/manage to automate everything. Some steps were always left to manual labor, most notably message passing and picking the initial input. The initial input was known as a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma#Crib-based_decryption"&gt;crib&lt;/a&gt;, and  is essentially an informed guess at partial plain text. It seems to have always been more of an art than a science to obtain, even involving some psychology to know where to look. By message passing, I mean that Bletchley Park was not just a bunch of machines: these were disconnected, so there had to actually be many people transcribing output from one machine, making relatively simple decisions (all lights lit!) and entering that output into the next machine. There were several good reasons to do it this way. It is easier to train staff than build a new and complex sorting machine. On top, war is messy, and the Germans changed their procedures several times, requiring agility in the workflow (the Germans were less likely to change their hardware). Over the course of the war, there was constant prototyping of different workflows around core mechanical infrastructure, and this experience helped abstract the generic modern computer (formally, a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine"&gt;Turing Machine&lt;/a&gt;) and eventually build it (unlike Charles Babbage's machine and Ada Lovelace's programs which remained theoretical).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The lesson of Bletchley Park is that it is sometimes easier but sufficient to build a social machine rather than a fully automated machine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine"&gt;social machine&lt;/a&gt; is an environment comprising humans and technology interacting and producing outputs or action which would not be possible without both parties present. The term became popular thanks to Tim Berners-Lee, who anticipated them along with the World Wide Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../bombe-back.jpg" class="align-left" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/bombe-back.jpg" style="width: 365.04px; height: 273.6px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook, for instance, serves as a social machine in multiple ways. You can pass on content to your friends, which they can "like" and comment on, they can tag you in pictures, etc. Every such action is logged, and this machine has a unique goal: to know you better and serve you more valuable ads. All the necessary information has to be volunteered by humans because machines would not have been able to guess it on their own. Sometimes this social machine actively uses your friends to disclose information you might have wanted to keep private, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/what-exactly-is-a-facebook-shadow-profile/#!bP6C2L"&gt;even if you are not a Facebook user!&lt;/a&gt; Kids ratting on their parents, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this relevant to ed tech? One of the most successful social machines in education is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://duolingo.com"&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;. While it offers students the option of learning a language, it is really built with the intention of translating the web, and uses a creative setup to find and motivate participants. Even the course creation is now crowdsourced, via its &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://incubator.duolingo.com/"&gt;incubator&lt;/a&gt;. MOOCs actually tend to rely heavily on the same type of crowdsourcing. Course creation is crowdsourced to &lt;strong&gt;professors, who can create custom social machines tailored to the topic at hand&lt;/strong&gt;. When the course is run, this machine collects information about who is a good student, who is bad, who is a deep thinker, who is meticulous, who defines their own path, etc. Eventually, the goal might be to evaluate all these characteristics at scale algorithmically (despite all the risks for algorithmic bias that this entails), but the key point is that it can be "faked" at first: via peer feedback and rubric grading, one can use power relationships to inject fairly complicated judgements into this machine, at scale, with little cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, other relatively complex MOOC services are also sometimes crowdsourced, such as translating course materials, or mutual technical support for the professors and students. One can expect that some of these tasks will eventually also be automated: for instance, some MOOC platforms already use intelligent agents (robots masquerading as humans) to answer student questions in the forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
MOOC platforms offer the option to professors to easily stand up their own social machines. What should be their purpose? Who should be responsible for them?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watters insist that Luddites were not rejecting technology, but rather rejecting exploitation. Crowdsourcing already carries significant risks of exploitation, particularly in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://florianschmidt.co/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/"&gt;domain of intellectual property&lt;/a&gt;, but this is not the only one. In another talk, she says that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/10/17/student-data-is-the-new-oil/"&gt;"Student data is the new oil"&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, this seems to be another path that all the big MOOC providers have chosen so far. A professor building a MOOC only helps the platform collect more private information about its users, maybe even under the guise of improving their user experience. But for what purpose exactly? Which engine is running off this oil? Where is it headed? Is this data helping for research in education? In social science? In human-computer interaction? Or simply for profit, selling that data to the highest bidder/best revenue model, without moral guidance? All these options are actively pursued right now, sometimes simultaneously, and professors preparing a MOOC should give great pause to these issues and think carefully at the setting where they have decided to do so. Possibly they might have to fight for the luxury of picking this setting. Professors have a lot of moral responsibility towards the students (the weakest cogs by far in this social machine), to make sure that the free-education-for-all mantra does not turn into another form of exploitation. Do these professors even fully understand the situation? Do they fully understand how &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldhHkVjLe7A"&gt;free-is-a-lie&lt;/a&gt;? Who carries the responsibility of informing them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research conducted without applied ethics is morally bankrupt because when scientists lack morals, outside sources can more easily manipulate their work for destructive purposes. In such situations, scientists are likely to adopt the rationalizations of that party to justify their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ashbrook.org/publications/respub-v8n1-cook/"&gt;Erica Cook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bletchley Park analogy, this moral responsibility is eclipsed by the dramatic circumstances of war. One person encodes, the other one decodes, some people die, some survive but at least it feels fair (to me at least, maybe blinded by my mathematicians' background). Yet the parallels outlined above remain as strong with Los Alamos and the atomic bomb, where Feynman was reorganising his own social machine to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://youtu.be/0ogSC6JKkrY?t=47m50s"&gt;perform simulations of atomic explosions&lt;/a&gt;, even holding competitions pitting his chimeric machine against actual IBM computers. Certainly, the ethical questions are more nagging with Los Alamos, but on either side of the Atlantic the machine operators never had the opportunity to raise concerns with what they were contributing to. In an environment full of (male) generals and (male) scientists the machines were mostly &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/bpt/Women/wrensOS.html"&gt;"manned" by women&lt;/a&gt;, within a society that didn't even pretend to give them an equal voice. After the war, many ethical question &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ashbrook.org/publications/respub-v8n1-cook/"&gt;hung squarely  and solely on the scientists' shoulders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we don't like the current MOOC models, what should be the way forward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Luddites were seeking to disrupt the technological disruption, and we as professors should seek to do the same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, one might argue this is part of our job, to help society move forward without fear of a challenge, criticism or controversy, as long as we can back our arguments with evidence. In today's conversation, business logic has misappropriated the words &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_M._Christensen"&gt;"disruption" and "innovation"&lt;/a&gt; and mostly tied them with technology. In fact, disruption is to be found anywhere in academia, if not more in the humanities: "why?" is a more powerful question than "how?". Certainly some MOOC providers have opened themselves up to this disruption themselves, through &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODL-owGjti8"&gt;overinflated claims of fixing with old technology something that was not necessarily broken&lt;/a&gt;. MOOCs are a fantastic opportunity to build truly new ways of learning, collaborating, discovering and generally helping society progress through exchange of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting these improved MOOCs off the ground will be hard. It will require dedication, transparency, freedom to tinker, accountability and tolerance for failure. Above all, it will require rock solid ethical ground, which is too easy to compromise in a competitive environment mixing academia and its "strategic relationships".&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>connected_course</category><category>crypto</category><category>edtech</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/social-teaching-machines.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2014 00:46:03 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
