Off Merton Field, above Deadman's Walk onto &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Church_Meadow,_Oxford"&gt;Christ Church Meadow&lt;/a&gt;. Uninterrupted grass landscape into the river, with rolling mist up to the river most mornings, &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;-style. In fact, Tolkien's office &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;  the apartment upstairs, and I like to think the view inspired him. How come, in a cramped city like this, I could enjoy this same view decades later, centuries after the construction of the building I was living in? Well, because in the byzantine world of Oxford real estate, one college (ChristChurch) owned that land, while another owned grazing rights for cattle on it (forgot which, presumably Merton itself). Not that tourists would see cattle in that field: every year, the college with grazing rights would rent sheep for just one day, and move it there. The theory was that &lt;strong&gt;if they didn't exercise their right, they would legally lose it&lt;/strong&gt;, and the other college could build whatever they wanted there and ruin the view (Wikipedia mentions a road that was defeated). &lt;strong&gt;The pace at Oxford allowed to think this through: custom is built over centuries, and preserved with yearly activities.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this long preamble?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was just in Goteborg for the #Chals14 conference, where a big part of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/moocs-as-inventions-chals14.html"&gt;my schpiel was that we should not succumb to the free-is-a-lie mantra of MOOCs&lt;/a&gt; and resist narrow views of the "Internet happening to education" (quoting George Siemens) based around technological determinism (quoting Evgeny Morozov). The afternoon session was in Swedish, so I was distracted and looking at Twitter. One person that I am following, Aral Balkan, tweeted this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Schiphol"&gt;@schiphol&lt;/a&gt; airport breaking EU law? They told me today that I could not opt of the full-body scanner.

&lt;a href="http://t.co/LfQ7k20ZLG"&gt;http://t.co/LfQ7k20ZLG&lt;/a&gt;

Via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alloy"&gt;@alloy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Aral Balkan (@aral) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aral/status/514736935978680320"&gt;September 24, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balkan is a privacy advocate, who has been trying to raise the attention of people to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://aralbalkan.com/notes/spyware-2.0/"&gt;Spyware 2.0 model&lt;/a&gt; employed by many companies now: in his Orwellian view, by offering free services, large corporations manage to convince us to give away all our data, so they can spy on us. He is leading the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ind.ie/manifesto"&gt;Indie-tech movement&lt;/a&gt; and peripherially (?) in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dmlcentral.net/blog/doug-belshaw/reclaiming-web-next-generation"&gt;Reclaim the Web movement&lt;/a&gt;, which also has declinations in the MOOC space (for instance with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/2014/09/known/"&gt;Known&lt;/a&gt;). His tweet got me pretty upset: a few years ago, Schiphol security classified a present from my mom, high quality Belgian chocolate paste, as a liquid. Back then I had checked, and legally they were, at least at the time, within their rights: individual employees have ultimate classification decision and chocolate paste is indeed a grey area. Still, because of an arbitrary decision by a person who gleefully threw away a present in the bin, I was forced to make-do with Swiss chocolate for a while, a clearly inferior proposition. If you want to dismiss my reasons to do this, you could say that I have a score to settle with Schiphol security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../schiphol-hand.jpg" class="align-right" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/schiphol-hand.jpg" style="width: 540.0px; height: 360.0px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As luck would have it, on my flight back to Zurich from Goteborg, I was flying through Schiphol. On the very same day as Balkan. On top, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/aral/status/514736935978680320"&gt;twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; had a ton of links to the relevant laws and websites, which were completely unambiguous. So all the work of retesting this more "scientifically" was cut out for me. In fact, &lt;strong&gt;one could argue that as an academic this is part of my work: to challenge institutions, spread knowledge, and contribute to society. These last two points made by many #Chals14 participants in the context of MOOCs.&lt;/strong&gt; I agree and generally take it seriously, especially living in a country where academic freedom is in the constitution (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19995395/"&gt;Art. 20&lt;/a&gt;), where I am paid well to think, connect dots, etc. My view of academia might smack of arrogance and overreach, but bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours later, I myself landed in Schiphol, and got out of the transit area so I would have to intentionally get back through security. Since I could not print my legal backups on time, I had written on my hand the references to European regulation, 185/2010 4.1.1.10, a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://english.nctv.nl/themes/Counterterrorism/Security_and_civil_aviation/Security_Scan/FAQ_3.aspx"&gt;Dutch website URL&lt;/a&gt; and my plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;&lt;li&gt;refuse body scanner twice;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask for an explanation of my rights;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;question the legality of their setup;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask for the name of the person I was talking to;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask to speak to a supervisor;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iterate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I approached the security scanner, I looked around. Nowhere was it written that I could opt out. It was simply written that I should "feel free to ask questions". In Balkan's case, this was not helpful at all: since the security employee seems to have violated the law, Balkan couldn't just point to a sign and say he was wrong. The fact that there was no sign is, according to me, already a violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before being screened by a security scanner, the passenger shall be informed of the technology used, the conditions associated to its use and the possibility to opt out from a security scanner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:02010R0185-20140409&amp;amp;from=EN"&gt;European regulation 185/2010&lt;/a&gt;, last line of article 4.1.1.10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I had to finally talk to a Schiphol security officer and refuse the scanner, our interaction validated all the care I put in preparing this (and my general approach to a few similar challenge-the-authority projects I am involved in): his reaction was simply to ask me "Why?", why I was refusing. If there is one thing I learned this summer, it is to ask myself "Why?" and have a good answer to this question &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id9" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, I could definitely answer it right away: "Because this is my right". &lt;strong&gt;By keeping a pretense of being citizen beta, I got the officer to volunteer the reason why he himself asked me "Why?"&lt;/strong&gt;: he volunteered "because sometimes people don't have the right information and think those are X-rays machines going through their skin" (regardless of the validity of the assertion, this is irrelevant to the fact that European law still allows me to opt out). I repeated that I was still refusing, and he said that was indeed my right, let me get around the scanner and started patting me down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To emphasize: &lt;strong&gt;this particular officer knew from the start that I it was my right to opt out&lt;/strong&gt;. While being perfectly courteous, he was making assumptions of my own ignorance, expecting to enlighten me with information about his very expensive, super advanced, and ultimately useless piece of technology &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id10" id="id2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;.  This &lt;strong&gt;explanation was supposed to somehow impress me, and lead me to willingly give away my own rights as a EU citizen (on EU soil)&lt;/strong&gt;. Given that I had gone to Goteborg to partly talk about technological determinism, with quotes of Zuckerberg on the evolving nature of privacy (including the "dumb fucks" quote, page 11 of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/goteborg-final.pdf"&gt;my slides&lt;/a&gt;), this was adding another layer of irony... There possibly was arrogance in my assumptions about my role as an academic, but certainly there were in the assumptions the officer was making: he didn't know about the Oxford sheep (presumably), all the necessary tabs opened and ready on my laptop, the writing on my hand, or the fact that I have quite a bit of experience with EU law (in the context of a separate private matter, I have previously encouraged the European Commission to initiate an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/your_rights/your_rights_en.htm"&gt;infringement procedure&lt;/a&gt; against my home country, Belgium. This is a &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; recommended and free legal avenue, available to any European citizen and maybe even resident).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once he had patted me down, and I had effectively gone through security, it was time to lay some of it out. Of course, I was quickly bounced around to the shift supervisor (who looked quite a bit senior). &lt;strong&gt;René was genuinely concerned and wanted to do the right thing: he took  pictures of my screen to get the relevant EU law lines and the original tweets. I told him to look for the #HelloSchiphol hashtag on Twitter. He thanked me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But again he dismissed Balkan as just a tweeter among others, and I had to insist that he actually had many followers who care about privacy, that he is a big shot taking on Google, etc. I shouldn't have had to do that, and neither should it have mattered that I am a university professor, yet he did remark on the fact &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id11" id="id3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. One can argue about my method and its transparency, but &lt;strong&gt;by playing dumb I actually got further&lt;/strong&gt; than just flashing legal printouts right away, since I now have &lt;strong&gt;one more data point on how Schiphol security officers respond to seemingly unprepared citizens concerned with airport security&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall, this experience with Schiphol security was very positive, and I don't have a grudge against them anymore (provided they add relevant signage).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I want to contrast this with another security theatre incident &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id12" id="id4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;, this time in the MOOC space. In September 5th &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/09/05/beyond-the-lms-newcastle-university/"&gt;talk by Audrey Watters&lt;/a&gt; about the Learning Management System, she says this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LMS was — is — designed as an Internet portal to the student information system, and much like the old portals of the Dot Com era, much like AOL for example, it cautions you when you try to venture outside of it. “ re you sure you want to leave AOL?” “Are you sure you want to leave the VLE?” “Aren’t you scared to be on the Web?” “There are strangers and strange ideas out there. Stay within the LMS! Stay within AOL!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—Audrey Watters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There I was in Schiphol, facing the same security theatre to cross an actual physical portal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watters might have been picking on older technologies (AOL and LMSes), but on that very same day (Sept 5th) the very same issues resurfaced for more modern technology, through Jonathan Mayer. Mayer is a lawyer, but also a PhD student at Stanford in computer science. Like Balkan, he is a big advocate for privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to come up with something that doesn’t count as market research or product improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.adexchanger.com/ad-exchange-news/privacy-advocate-jonathan-mayer-has-had-it-with-do-not-track/"&gt;Jonathan Mayer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far his research has cost &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mashable.com/2014/09/23/stanford-google-privacy-research/"&gt;Google 22.5M USD in fines&lt;/a&gt;, and what he has said in interviews has earned him the distinction of being &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/iab-mozilla/"&gt;labeled by the online advertising trade union&lt;/a&gt; a "Bolshevik of the Internet world" &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id13" id="id5"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;.  He is 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is also teaching a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/surveillance"&gt;course on Surveillance Law&lt;/a&gt; on Coursera (i.e. how the NSA, FBI, etc are legally accessing information about US citizens). A week before his course, he published a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://webpolicy.org/2014/09/04/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-coursera/"&gt;blog post detailing some security flaws of Coursera itself&lt;/a&gt;. This was at his personal blog, but I assume he would consider this part of his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Courserians, we are writing about a topic we take very seriously – user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;amp;ei=L48jVJSRK6WG8QeY6oG4Cg#q=Brennan+Saeta"&gt;Brennan Saeta&lt;/a&gt; - Infrastructure Engineering, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/96686805237/response-to-reported-vulnerability-in-instructor-access"&gt;Coursera official blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coursera's response was given in a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/96686805237/response-to-reported-vulnerability-in-instructor-access"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Slate has &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/09/05/coursera_is_patching_vulnerabilities_found_by_jonathan_mayer_a_surveillance.html"&gt;criticized that response&lt;/a&gt;, and smartly highlighted that any attack vector is good for a hacker. &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id14" id="id6"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team, Infrastructure, is taking a security class together, learning about cryptography because this is kind of relevant to security. So we try to improve ourselves and learn about best practices as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;amp;ei=L48jVJSRK6WG8QeY6oG4Cg#q=Nick%20Dellamaggiore"&gt;Nick Dellamaggiore&lt;/a&gt; - Infrastructure Lead, at Coursera Partners' Conference 2014 &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id15" id="id7"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his talk at the Coursera Partners' Conference, Dellamaggiore has a background slide with the actual class that his Infrastructure team takes: Cryptography I, on Coursera of course, by Dan Boneh (ironically from Stanford). I went and looked at that course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;img alt="../crypto1.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/crypto1.jpg" style="width: 936.6px; height: 431.9px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, 9 minutes into the first video, &lt;em&gt;social engineering&lt;/em&gt; is highlighted as nullifying the value of encryption and many other security methods. Given that Coursera superprofessors are supposed to be the best of the best (at their very very narrow discipline), and given the way academia works, I expect a fair share of Coursera professors to be greying a bit. &lt;strong&gt;I want to question how the decision was made by Coursera to think those professors could be trusted with this level of access&lt;/strong&gt;. I have had access to more information than the general public to help answer this question, but do not know enough at this time to actually answer it. &lt;strong&gt;I am not willing to reshare publicly the information I still have because of personal legal risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's great, but how do we keep data from falling in the wrong hands, say they try to access our physical machines in the cloud or our production databases or what not. So this slide is a little bit more technical, so bear with me, I will kind of go through it quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—Nick Dellamaggiore - Infrastructure Lead, a few seconds later&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lack of public transparency is itself is a concern, in the context of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://asilomar-highered.info"&gt;Asilomar convention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Without more transparency from Coursera on their data policies, I have genuine concern that Coursera itself is just using security theatre for commercial advantage&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id16" id="id8"&gt;[8]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case it is not clear at this stage, I still have a score to settle with Coursera, but I try to be a patient man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone’s not going to follow the practices, that’s something that society faces in general, and that’s why we have police and courts [..] In the academic world, we don’t need police and courts, but we have academic discipline, we have academic institutional standards, we have research standards. If people don’t comply with those, they do need to be deal[t] with. In our set of relationships, that’s between the university and the instructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/07/15/after-massiveteaching-questions-about-mooc-quality-control"&gt;Vivek Goel&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Academic Strategist, Coursera and apparently also "&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/77181132056/welcome-vivek-goel-to-courseras-leadership-team"&gt;still a professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health and the Institute for Health Policy, Management &amp;amp; Evaluation&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goel is textually correct of course. But he is also intentionally misleading (by offering this generic quote in an article about a course that I ran). And he is also unintentionally short-sighted, for very many reasons. One is that he indeed reminds me of looking up the local rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Zurich (UZH) is an institution with a strong commitment to the free and open pursuit of scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scholarship is the acquisition, the advancement and the &lt;strong&gt;dissemination of knowledge in a methodological and critical manner&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To flourish, scholarship must be &lt;strong&gt;free from external influences, constraints and ideological pressures&lt;/strong&gt;. The University of Zurich is committed to &lt;strong&gt;unrestricted freedom in research and teaching&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic freedom calls for a high degree of responsibility, including &lt;strong&gt;reflection on the ethical implications of research activities for humans, animals and the environment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.uzh.ch/about/basics/mission_en.html"&gt;University of Zurich's mission statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another is that he has resorted to using innuendos. I can use my own too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see all the platforms now really starting to talk about the social aspects [..] of learning, which come from the other theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't worry, the nickname is based on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://youtu.be/PCV5xBPoxnE?t=4m47s"&gt;actual data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I was unprepared to enter that debate there with the security officer, not knowing exactly which model Schiphol was using. I suspect the officer was not ready either. The point is that we shouldn't have to, as this particular European law was drafted anticipating rapid evolution in this security field, both regarding threat detection and evasion.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id11" rules="none"&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label"&gt;&lt;col&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;He only learned that at the very end, when I wrote #HelloSchiphol on my business card. There is, so far in my life, only one (repeated) instance where I have flashed the fact that I am a professor: apartment hunting in Switzerland, for which competition is so fierce that local society admits pretty much &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; move is fair. The fact that many academics pride themselves not to use business cards or Twitter show a profound lack of understanding of their own place in the physical and digital world: conversation with any other citizen is important and that might require using their medium.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id12" rules="none"&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label"&gt;&lt;col&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;To use the language of Bruce Schneier.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id13" rules="none"&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label"&gt;&lt;col&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id5"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I will admit it, I am jealous and do hope that Mayer has that written on his business card. As I explained in  &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/the-academic-social-machine-part-I.html"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; I currently fulfill four out of five crowdsourced stereotypes about academics, and am unsure of others' perception of me on the fifth (but I know where I stand).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id14" rules="none"&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label"&gt;&lt;col&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id6"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I also did at the time, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/96686805237/response-to-reported-vulnerability-in-instructor-access"&gt;in the comments to the Coursera blog post&lt;/a&gt;, for the fact that Coursera was not properly acknowledging the value of Mayer's work for them in testing their platform.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id15" rules="none"&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col class="label"&gt;&lt;col&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="label"&gt;&lt;a class="fn-backref" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id7"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This was at the &lt;em&gt;Data Privacy and Policy&lt;/em&gt; talk.

This is a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/chals14?fref=ts"&gt;reunion of Swedish universities&lt;/a&gt; convened by Jonas Gilbert (Chalmers University Library) to discuss MOOCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My slides are available &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/goteborg-final.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the talk, I discussed the idea that MOOCs are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine"&gt;social machines&lt;/a&gt; put in the hands of professors (thanks to my PhD student &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?id=assistenten&amp;amp;L=&amp;amp;key1=4144&amp;amp;key2=&amp;amp;key3=&amp;amp;keySemId="&gt;Helen Riedtmann&lt;/a&gt; for boiling down my ideas to this simple statement), and quoted Evgeny Morozov, which I am reading at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, it was much better to be last speaker of the morning, to offer a (hopefully constructive) balance to some of the other points made earlier. It also lead naturally to interesting discussions (including with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/the-president-and-vice-presidents/Pages/karin-markides-president.aspx"&gt;Karin Markides&lt;/a&gt;, who asked me a few questions above my pay grade. It is much easier to convey these ideas offline than online, but indeed the audience is smaller and different).  Still, the digital world was interesting too: I was glad to see how Twitter added to the talk &lt;strong&gt;for me&lt;/strong&gt; afterwards (something I am not used to, since very few mathematicians use Twitter), which helped me assess how my ideas were received. In a talk about MOOCs' risks and opportunities, someone immediately called me up on the risks of the opportunities, with a reference to Jaron Lanier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/chals14?src=hash"&gt;#chals14&lt;/a&gt; The social machine; I wonder what Jaron Lanier would say about that. Read "You are not a gadget" for a critical take in this.&lt;/p&gt;— Thommy Eriksson (@KuggenMedialab) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KuggenMedialab/status/514714933813338113"&gt;September 24, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now adding this to my reading list, since in fact he seems to talk a lot about mathematics too! It was also good to meet &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jorg.pareigis.se/"&gt;Jorg Pareigis&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;amp;q=%23ccourses&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;#ccourses participant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two quick mementos for myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have now traveled to the first 15 countries to constitute the European Union.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have never been before in such last minute trouble with computers: still private Google Slides locked out of my account, requiring Google two-factor authentication through a dead cell phone... Literally managed to get to the slides as I was walking to the stand.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;img alt="../worklearn.jpg" class="align-right" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/worklearn.jpg" style="width: 346.4px; height: 85.6px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my co-authors (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hci.uni-hannover.de/people/markus"&gt;Markus Krause&lt;/a&gt;) is co-organising a workshop on that topic, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.worklearn.org/"&gt;WorkLearn 2014&lt;/a&gt;. It will take place in Pittsburgh November 2-4, as part of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.humancomputation.com/2014/"&gt;Human Computation conference HCOMP2014&lt;/a&gt;. Human Computation is another expression interchangeable for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/social-teaching-machines.html"&gt;social machine&lt;/a&gt;, although it has different connotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stated motivation of the workshop is very ambitious:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online education and crowdsourcing communities are addressing similar problems in educating, motivating and evaluating students and workers. The online learning community succeeds in increasing the supply side of the cognitively skilled labor market, and the crowdsourcing at scale community creates a larger marketplace for cognitively skilled work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linking online platforms for crowd work with platforms for MOOCs has the potential to: provide knowledge and training at a massive scale to contributors; collect data that identify expert skills; engage contributors in simultaneously working and learning in a social environment; and organize large communities around online courses on specific topics. These all provide new opportunities to support and deploy sophisticated algorithms for crowd learning and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most successful example in this direction is of course &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://duolingo.com"&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;, which helps translate the web while using volunteer labor by language learners. If one omits the learning, the strategy there is not that different from the strategy used by my Coursera coworker &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/bernstein"&gt;Abraham Bernstein&lt;/a&gt; to translate books using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk"&gt;Amazon Mechanical Turk&lt;/a&gt;, and indeed part of his efforts aim to design effective tools to program those social machines (with the programming language CrowdLang).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;embed&gt;&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/emCABRV2cUA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have always had some qualms about the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://florianschmidt.co/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/"&gt;ethics of crowdsourcing&lt;/a&gt;, even though it can clearly be used for good: the prototypical success story is in the work of Ushahidi during the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ushahidi.com/blog/2012/01/12/haiti-and-the-power-of-crowdsourcing/"&gt;2010 Haiti earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. I was thus very happy to see over Labor Day 2014 that Michael Bernstein from Stanford announced &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://crowdresearch.org/blog/?p=9039"&gt;guidelines for academic requesters on Amazon Mechanical Turk&lt;/a&gt;. He explains the rationale for this (a Turker is a worker on a crowdsourcing platform):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
An IRB-approved researcher experimented on the [crowdsourcing] platform unannounced. The result was Turker confusion, strife, and wasted time, in a system where time is what it takes to make ends meet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guidelines were themselves crowdsourced, designed together with the Turkers (it's only natural!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, over the summer, there was a huge controversy over the iffy ethics of social platforms experimentation. This is due to the release at the very end of June 2014 of a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/06/29/facebook-doesnt-understand-the-fuss-about-its-emotion-manipulation-study/"&gt;Facebook experiment on its users&lt;/a&gt; (don't miss the Cornell IRB flowchart there). There are a ton of links about this, but the best is probably the account by Mary L. Gray of an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://marylgray.org/?page_id=203"&gt;ethics panel that took place at the Microsoft Research Faculty Summit&lt;/a&gt; (and unfortunately was published with much delay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this should give serious pause to any educator. One can see lots of fields suddenly getting much too close, with very different or inexistent values. Online learners, just as Turkers, are vulnerable. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2014/06/the-ethics-of-digital-scholarship.html"&gt;Martin Weller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2014/01/13/the-vulnerability-of-learning/"&gt;George Siemens&lt;/a&gt; have recently insisted on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Anyone wants to submit a position paper (2 pages) on the topic? Any of my co-learners in MOOCs would like to see what we can do? We could, well... crowdsource it...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her talk, Watters physically bases herself at Bletchley Park, a place of invention, ingenuity and deceit that greatly contributed to the Allies' war effort and incidentally the evolution of computing. She then steps back in time to Ludd and his followers, who rebelled against the introduction of machinery in their work. She then segways into the Frankenstein story of a creation abandoned by its master and finally draws parallels with the situation in ed tech today and the "promises" of teaching machines. This was an impossibly bad and short summary of a very good talk, so I would highly recommend to any reader lost here to go read the original. After doing that, please come back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="900" height="600" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/6qwZm56UadE?rel=0&amp;amp;hd=1&amp;amp;wmode=transparent"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;During World War II, cryptographers worked at Bletchley Park to decipher German and Japanese secret messages. These were encoded by various versions of a machine called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine"&gt;Enigma&lt;/a&gt;, a typewriter wired with multiple electrical contacts that constantly shuffled letters around. It is really a quite dumb but very messy and obfuscated process, with one useful property: at any stage it created an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics)"&gt;involution&lt;/a&gt;, so one can use the same machine to both encrypt and decrypt. You can see little Millie demonstrating this in the video above (shot in September 2013 by yours truly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../bombe-front.jpg" class="align-right" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/bombe-front.jpg" style="width: 365.04px; height: 273.6px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To attack the ciphered messages, the cryptologists at Bletchley Park did not build full on computers, but instead  machines that could simulate many Enigmas in parallel (36 Enigmas per &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe"&gt;Turing Bombe&lt;/a&gt;). These also had extra wiring which encoded additional properties of the Enigma protocol. On any given day, around 200 of these machines were used to recover the common settings for all the encrypted messages sent that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has always fascinated me with Blecthley Park is the &lt;strong&gt;subtle interplay between humans and the machines&lt;/strong&gt;. While the heavy computations were done by those Bombes, the British did not seek/manage to automate everything. Some steps were always left to manual labor, most notably message passing and picking the initial input. The initial input was known as a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma#Crib-based_decryption"&gt;crib&lt;/a&gt;, and  is essentially an informed guess at partial plain text. It seems to have always been more of an art than a science to obtain, even involving some psychology to know where to look. By message passing, I mean that Bletchley Park was not just a bunch of machines: these were disconnected, so there had to actually be many people transcribing output from one machine, making relatively simple decisions (all lights lit!) and entering that output into the next machine. There were several good reasons to do it this way. It is easier to train staff than build a new and complex sorting machine. On top, war is messy, and the Germans changed their procedures several times, requiring agility in the workflow (the Germans were less likely to change their hardware). Over the course of the war, there was constant prototyping of different workflows around core mechanical infrastructure, and this experience helped abstract the generic modern computer (formally, a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine"&gt;Turing Machine&lt;/a&gt;) and eventually build it (unlike Charles Babbage's machine and Ada Lovelace's programs which remained theoretical).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The lesson of Bletchley Park is that it is sometimes easier but sufficient to build a social machine rather than a fully automated machine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine"&gt;social machine&lt;/a&gt; is an environment comprising humans and technology interacting and producing outputs or action which would not be possible without both parties present. The term became popular thanks to Tim Berners-Lee, who anticipated them along with the World Wide Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../bombe-back.jpg" class="align-left" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/bombe-back.jpg" style="width: 365.04px; height: 273.6px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook, for instance, serves as a social machine in multiple ways. You can pass on content to your friends, which they can "like" and comment on, they can tag you in pictures, etc. Every such action is logged, and this machine has a unique goal: to know you better and serve you more valuable ads. All the necessary information has to be volunteered by humans because machines would not have been able to guess it on their own. Sometimes this social machine actively uses your friends to disclose information you might have wanted to keep private, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/what-exactly-is-a-facebook-shadow-profile/#!bP6C2L"&gt;even if you are not a Facebook user!&lt;/a&gt; Kids ratting on their parents, in other words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this relevant to ed tech? One of the most successful social machines in education is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://duolingo.com"&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;. While it offers students the option of learning a language, it is really built with the intention of translating the web, and uses a creative setup to find and motivate participants. Even the course creation is now crowdsourced, via its &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://incubator.duolingo.com/"&gt;incubator&lt;/a&gt;. MOOCs actually tend to rely heavily on the same type of crowdsourcing. Course creation is crowdsourced to &lt;strong&gt;professors, who can create custom social machines tailored to the topic at hand&lt;/strong&gt;. When the course is run, this machine collects information about who is a good student, who is bad, who is a deep thinker, who is meticulous, who defines their own path, etc. Eventually, the goal might be to evaluate all these characteristics at scale algorithmically (despite all the risks for algorithmic bias that this entails), but the key point is that it can be "faked" at first: via peer feedback and rubric grading, one can use power relationships to inject fairly complicated judgements into this machine, at scale, with little cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, other relatively complex MOOC services are also sometimes crowdsourced, such as translating course materials, or mutual technical support for the professors and students. One can expect that some of these tasks will eventually also be automated: for instance, some MOOC platforms already use intelligent agents (robots masquerading as humans) to answer student questions in the forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
MOOC platforms offer the option to professors to easily stand up their own social machines. What should be their purpose? Who should be responsible for them?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watters insist that Luddites were not rejecting technology, but rather rejecting exploitation. Crowdsourcing already carries significant risks of exploitation, particularly in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://florianschmidt.co/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/"&gt;domain of intellectual property&lt;/a&gt;, but this is not the only one. In another talk, she says that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/10/17/student-data-is-the-new-oil/"&gt;"Student data is the new oil"&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, this seems to be another path that all the big MOOC providers have chosen so far. A professor building a MOOC only helps the platform collect more private information about its users, maybe even under the guise of improving their user experience. But for what purpose exactly? Which engine is running off this oil? Where is it headed? Is this data helping for research in education? In social science? In human-computer interaction? Or simply for profit, selling that data to the highest bidder/best revenue model, without moral guidance? All these options are actively pursued right now, sometimes simultaneously, and professors preparing a MOOC should give great pause to these issues and think carefully at the setting where they have decided to do so. Possibly they might have to fight for the luxury of picking this setting. Professors have a lot of moral responsibility towards the students (the weakest cogs by far in this social machine), to make sure that the free-education-for-all mantra does not turn into another form of exploitation. Do these professors even fully understand the situation? Do they fully understand how &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldhHkVjLe7A"&gt;free-is-a-lie&lt;/a&gt;? Who carries the responsibility of informing them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research conducted without applied ethics is morally bankrupt because when scientists lack morals, outside sources can more easily manipulate their work for destructive purposes. In such situations, scientists are likely to adopt the rationalizations of that party to justify their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ashbrook.org/publications/respub-v8n1-cook/"&gt;Erica Cook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bletchley Park analogy, this moral responsibility is eclipsed by the dramatic circumstances of war. One person encodes, the other one decodes, some people die, some survive but at least it feels fair (to me at least, maybe blinded by my mathematicians' background). Yet the parallels outlined above remain as strong with Los Alamos and the atomic bomb, where Feynman was reorganising his own social machine to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://youtu.be/0ogSC6JKkrY?t=47m50s"&gt;perform simulations of atomic explosions&lt;/a&gt;, even holding competitions pitting his chimeric machine against actual IBM computers. Certainly, the ethical questions are more nagging with Los Alamos, but on either side of the Atlantic the machine operators never had the opportunity to raise concerns with what they were contributing to. In an environment full of (male) generals and (male) scientists the machines were mostly &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/bpt/Women/wrensOS.html"&gt;"manned" by women&lt;/a&gt;, within a society that didn't even pretend to give them an equal voice. After the war, many ethical question &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ashbrook.org/publications/respub-v8n1-cook/"&gt;hung squarely  and solely on the scientists' shoulders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we don't like the current MOOC models, what should be the way forward?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Luddites were seeking to disrupt the technological disruption, and we as professors should seek to do the same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, one might argue this is part of our job, to help society move forward without fear of a challenge, criticism or controversy, as long as we can back our arguments with evidence. In today's conversation, business logic has misappropriated the words &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_M._Christensen"&gt;"disruption" and "innovation"&lt;/a&gt; and mostly tied them with technology. In fact, disruption is to be found anywhere in academia, if not more in the humanities: "why?" is a more powerful question than "how?". Certainly some MOOC providers have opened themselves up to this disruption themselves, through &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODL-owGjti8"&gt;overinflated claims of fixing with old technology something that was not necessarily broken&lt;/a&gt;. MOOCs are a fantastic opportunity to build truly new ways of learning, collaborating, discovering and generally helping society progress through exchange of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting these improved MOOCs off the ground will be hard. It will require dedication, transparency, freedom to tinker, accountability and tolerance for failure. Above all, it will require rock solid ethical ground, which is too easy to compromise in a competitive environment mixing academia and its "strategic relationships".&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>connected_course</category><category>crypto</category><category>edtech</category><category>social_machine</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/social-teaching-machines.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2014 00:46:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Connected Course: Introduction</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/connected-course-introduction.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;This is an introductory post for the connected course taking place at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://connectedcourses.net"&gt;connectedcourses.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Paul-Olivier Dehaye, I am a research mathematician in Zurich. I have taught for close to 15 years at university level, and two years ago started investing time in online education. Last year I taught a &lt;cite&gt;Programming in python&lt;/cite&gt; SPOC and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/massiveteaching"&gt;Teaching goes massive: New skills required&lt;/a&gt; on Coursera, as well as supervising several edtech projects with students. I am rerunning the python SPOC in the Fall 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course seems to match my interests very closely, and I am looking forward to relating the themes explored in the course with my own experiences in higher education. I am hoping to learn a lot, contribute positively to the discussion, and maybe get some peer feedback. Of particular resonance to me are issues of silos, faculty autonomy and independence, vulnerability (of students and instructor), censorship, data privacy, ethics and co-discovery (in addition to co-learning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also interested in the community of this course itself: are there marked differences between STEM and other fields? How to make STEM higher ed professors at research institutions understand the importance of those issues? How to communicate that bad decisions now could significantly affect the future of their profession?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to personal reasons, I am not entirely sure of how sustained my effort in the course will be, but will do my best!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am participating in this course as an individual, a student seeking to learn more, and not acting as a representative of my employer. Undoubtedly though what I learn here I will seek to reapply in my professional life.
Should you have any question about my motivation in participating in this course, please ask me below or in private. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>connected_course</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/connected-course-introduction.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2014 10:59:27 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
