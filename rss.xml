This is a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/chals14?fref=ts"&gt;reunion of Swedish universities&lt;/a&gt; convened by Jonas Gilbert (Chalmers University Library) to discuss MOOCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My slides are available &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/goteborg-final.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the talk, I discussed the idea that MOOCs are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine"&gt;social machines&lt;/a&gt; put in the hands of professors (thanks to my PhD student &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?id=assistenten&amp;amp;L=&amp;amp;key1=4144&amp;amp;key2=&amp;amp;key3=&amp;amp;keySemId="&gt;Helen Riedtmann&lt;/a&gt; for boiling down my ideas to this simple statement), and quoted Evgeny Morozov, which I am reading at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, it was much better to be last speaker of the morning, to offer a (hopefully constructive) balance to some of the other points made earlier. It also lead naturally to interesting discussions (including with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/the-president-and-vice-presidents/Pages/karin-markides-president.aspx"&gt;Karin Markides&lt;/a&gt;, who asked me a few questions above my pay grade. It is much easier to convey these ideas offline than online, but indeed the audience is smaller and different).  Still, the digital world was interesting too: I was glad to see how Twitter added to the talk &lt;strong&gt;for me&lt;/strong&gt; afterwards (something I am not used to, since very few mathematicians use Twitter), since it helped me assess how my ideas were received. In a talk about MOOCs' risks and opportunities, someone immediately called me up on the risks of the opportunities, with a reference to Jaron Lanier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/chals14?src=hash"&gt;#chals14&lt;/a&gt; The social machine; I wonder what Jaron Lanier would say about that. Read "You are not a gadget" for a critical take in this.&lt;/p&gt;— Thommy Eriksson (@KuggenMedialab) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KuggenMedialab/status/514714933813338113"&gt;September 24, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now adding this to my reading list, since in fact he seems to talk a lot about mathematics too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two quick mementos for myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have now traveled to the first 15 countries to constitute the European Union.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have never been before in such last minute trouble with computers: still private Google Slides locked out of my account, requiring Google two-factor authentication through a dead cell phone... Literally managed to get to the slide as I was walking to the stand.&lt;/li&gt;

This the type of lecture where people expect a Nobel prize winner to show up. Well, unless it is a mathematics one (the topic rotates among a few sciences), in which case it is OK if the speaker only has a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal"&gt;Fields medal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, it was the latter. The speaker was &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Voevodsky"&gt;Vladimir Voevodsky&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study"&gt;Institute for Advanced Study&lt;/a&gt; in Princeton (the same institute where Einstein and many other brilliant scientists were coopted following great successes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voevodsky's initial success was in proving the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milnor_conjecture"&gt;Milnor conjecture&lt;/a&gt;, but he hasn't stopped there. He has announced a proof of the Bloch-Kato conjecture as well, and is now working on Homotopy Type Theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theory is tied to the foundations of mathematics. To the layman, it really asks deep questions about what mathematics is, and how mathematics is constructed and improved, both by computers and humans. In some ways, he is trying to scientifically map out mathematics, and during the talk suggested a 500 year horizon to do that (part of many bombastic and exciting claims made by very smart mathematicians, such as Thomas Hales at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJx8bFQbHsA"&gt;end of his lecture here&lt;/a&gt;, who are willing to challenge the statu quo). Of course, one needs to start "small", and this is what Voevodsky explained in Zurich, his vision of the &lt;em&gt;Foundations of Mathematics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this he had three times one hour, which he sensibly divided into: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vladimirias/2014_Paul_Bernays_Lectures/blob/master/2014_09_Bernays_1%20presentation.pdf?raw=true"&gt;past&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vladimirias/2014_Paul_Bernays_Lectures/blob/master/2014_09_Bernays_2%20presentation.pdf?raw=true"&gt;present&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vladimirias/2014_Paul_Bernays_Lectures/blob/master/2014_09_Bernays_3%20presentation.pdf?raw=true"&gt;future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to focus here on the "past" talk. He started it by quoting wikipedia's definition of &lt;em&gt;Foundations of Mathematics&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../wikipedia-foundations.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/wikipedia-foundations.jpg" style="width: 616.5px; height: 236.0px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;and highlighted that there were two parts to this definition: the &lt;em&gt;mathematical concepts&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;metamathematical concepts&lt;/em&gt; (the &lt;em&gt;structures that form the language&lt;/em&gt;). He then went on to explain the presence of this dichotomy through the ages: discrete vs. continuous, pure vs. applied,  theorem vs. problem (&lt;em&gt;an inquiry the
answer to which is a construction of an object&lt;/em&gt;), and eventually touched on this account of what mathematics is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../grassmann.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/grassmann.jpg" style="width: 617.5px; height: 308.5px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voevodsky's interpretation of what Grassmann is saying is thus: &lt;strong&gt;mathematics is seen as rising from many independent roots and acquiring wholeness only through the intertwining of the lines arising from these roots&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>foundations</category><category>mathematics</category><category>rhizo14</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/paul-bernays-lectures-at-eth-zurich.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 13 Sep 2014 19:44:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Coursera contracts of Stony Brook, Roma, UNC, Colorado, Kentucky, Michigan, UToronto, UCSC (and your university?)</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/coursera-contracts-of-stony-brook-roma-unc-colorado-kentucky-michigan-utoronto-ucsc.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Scholarship of the XXIst century will include a lot of research on teaching, learning, and citizen science. MOOCs offer fantastic opportunities in this area. The XXIst century should also probably include scholarship of its own labor practices, or at least some concerted effort to stay afloat of developments in the profession. Asymmetric information can hurt badly in negociations. For this reason, it could be helpful to gather all &lt;strong&gt;Coursera Framework Agreements&lt;/strong&gt; that have landed on the internet (so far) in one place. Those agreements bind the university administration and Coursera, and package within them the actual contract to be signed later by the instructor (and guests), both with the administration and with Coursera. On top, any user of Coursera requires an account which is bound by its own Terms of Service &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/coursera-contracts-of-stony-brook-roma-unc-colorado-kentucky-michigan-utoronto-ucsc.html#id2" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By simply googling around (mostly for &lt;em&gt;Coursera Framework Agreement&lt;/em&gt;), I was able to find the following eight contracts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-Colorado.pdf"&gt;U Colorado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-Kentucky.pdf"&gt;U Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-Michigan.pdf"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-Roma.pdf"&gt;University of Roma (Sapienza)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-Stony_Brook.pdf"&gt;University of Stony Brook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-UCSC.pdf"&gt;UC Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-UNC.pdf"&gt;University of North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-UToronto.pdf"&gt;University of Toronto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all of those are signed, some are just preliminary and might not match the final version.
Some of those were originally obtained through Freedom of Information requests, while others were obviously misplaced. Some seem to have been removed from the web since, so I put them back here. &lt;strong&gt;The more interesting aspects here are the subtle variations between these contracts&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should you have one that you want to share, feel free to send it to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also include the following &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/coursera-UNC-CDA.pdf"&gt;Course Development Agreement&lt;/a&gt; for UNC. This contract is packaged within the Framework Agreement, and one is signed for each course at UNC, according to the CFA. It is relatively short, but refers to external guidelines located on the Coursera Partner Portal (i.e. online, inaccessible without an account with different permissions than a regular student account).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It includes the rollout policy for a particular course: 1.d.i and 1.d.ii dictate that the content should be uploaded one month ahead of the course start for the first week of content, and two weeks ahead for the second week, but "&lt;em&gt;[these] will not apply to the University Courses beginning in the Fall of 2013 if the achievement of these requirements is not practical or not feasible&lt;/em&gt;". UNC &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gazette.unc.edu/2013/02/26/unc-to-offer-moocs-with-coursera/"&gt;joined Coursera&lt;/a&gt; on February 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDA also includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="5"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course reusability&lt;/strong&gt;: Ensuring that the content can be easily reused in &lt;strong&gt;subsequent offerings of the course for which the instructor might not be involved&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a.&lt;/strong&gt; Avoiding references to particular dates in lecture videos (e.g., "The homework will be due next Monday, March 4" or "It’s a beautiful summer day today");&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b.&lt;/strong&gt; After the first offering of the course, &lt;strong&gt;systematically editing/removing references to dates and episodes that are specific to the first offering of the course&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., an announcement about correcting a typo on the final exam, or about extending due dates because of Hurricane Sandy), as well as references to activities for which instructor involvement is necessary (e.g., "We hope to see you at the next live Google+ Hangout").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—Coursera Development Agreement, to be signed by Coursera instructors at UNC (emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have read through quite a lot of this, so if you have any question feel free to ask!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his recent post &lt;em&gt;You are not alone&lt;/em&gt; on the Salaita affair, Jonathan Rees &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://academeblog.org/2014/09/08/you-are-not-alone/"&gt;comments on the social media policies&lt;/a&gt; enacted at the Colorado, Kentucky and New Mexico state systems. He encourages other professors to speak up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few of us can be sure whether or not our campus is really the canary in the higher education coal mine. However, better mine safety everywhere eventually benefits everyone with a pick and shovel. The more we professors talk to each other, both on social media and off, the better off we’ll all be when bad ideas surface that may someday affect us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—Jonathan Rees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evocation of the canary is very beautiful. It resonates quite a bit: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html"&gt;ETH Zurich&lt;/a&gt; was after all founded to help the Swiss develop their own railway systems. In any case, looking back at his writing, Rees has really dug in the Coursera &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/dear-superprofessors-your-labor-has-value/"&gt;labor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/09/03/unbundle-yourself/"&gt;practices&lt;/a&gt;. This seems like a good opportunity to continue my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-i.html"&gt;edtech policies series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some googling, one can easily find the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.colorado.edu/bfa/INITIATIVES/CourseraK2013.pdf"&gt;Coursera Framework Agreement&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;em&gt;Coursera Inc., a Delaware corporation [..] and the Board of Regents of the University of Colorado [..] for the benefit of the University of Colorado Boulder&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../colorado-google.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/colorado-google.jpg" style="width: 545.0px; height: 123.0px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independently of any stereotype that as an academic &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/the-academic-social-machine-part-I.html"&gt;I hate capitalism&lt;/a&gt;, another stereotype could be that I also quite like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/paul-olivier-dehaye/insane-travel-insurance-policy/228313430077"&gt;to read contracts&lt;/a&gt;. Of course this one makes for a particularly interesting read: it is supposed to hint at how MOOCs will be sustainable for the UC system and how Coursera, Inc. will outlast its &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coursera"&gt;85M dollars "gifts" from venture capital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract details the various rights and obligations of the parties involved, the different Coursera monetization strategies (ten instead of the eight like in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/400864/coursera-fully-executed-agreement.pdf"&gt;2012 Michigan contract&lt;/a&gt;), the Course Acceptance Procedures, the responsibility of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/72903326640/introducing-the-2014-rotation-of-courseras-university"&gt;University Advisory Board&lt;/a&gt; when things go wrong, etc. Of particular interest to me is how it already packages in Exhibit G-1 the relationship between an instructor and the university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also includes the following gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hereby release, discharge, and promise not to sue Company and its affiliates, successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, demands, costs and/or causes of actions of any nature arising out of or in connection with the exercise of any rights herein granted, including, without limitation, any claim for infringement, right of publicity, libel, slander, defamation, moral rights, invasion of privacy or violation of any other rights relating to any Content I upload, share or otherwise provide in connection with use of the Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—Exhibit G-1, Form of Agreement for Instructors and Guest Presenters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, IANAL but once the instructor signs this, s/he is giving free pass to Coursera for any libel, slander, defamation, invasion of privacy etc against her/himself. I don't know the backstory on how the faculty at Colorado accepted this, but would be very interested. At UCSC, the collective bargaining chapter has on the other hand been &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ucscfa.org/2013/06/scfas-ongoing-discussion-concerning-ucscs-contract-with-coursera/"&gt;very critical&lt;/a&gt;, as has been discussed in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-i.html"&gt;part I&lt;/a&gt; of this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rees' words on this are very apt, to his credit a year ago already:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point you have to realize that you do not work in a vacuum. Teaching a MOOC or not teaching a MOOC, speaking out in favor of them or remaining silent – these things all have an effect on the rest of your profession. You can’t just declare that MOOCs are the future and let the chips fall where they may. You have the ability to influence what kind of future we’ll all face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—Jonathan Rees (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/dear-superprofessors-your-labor-has-value/"&gt;Labor Day 2013&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we guess what XXIst century education might guarantee in terms of labor rights? Is there an online strike clause in any of them? All I could find is called &lt;em&gt;Force Majeure&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each party is excused from performance of this Agreement (other than for any payments due) and will not be liable for any delay in whole or in part caused by the occurrence of any contigency beyond the reasonable control of such Party. These contigencies include, without limitation, war, sabotage, insurrection, riot or other acts of civil disobedience, act of public enemy, failure or delay in transportation, act of government or any agency or subdivision thereof affecting the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, judicial action, &lt;strong&gt;labor dispute&lt;/strong&gt;, student disorders, accident, fire, explosion, flood, severe weather, natural disaster or other &lt;strong&gt;act of God&lt;/strong&gt;, shortage of labor, hardware failure, interruptions or &lt;strong&gt;failure of the Internet&lt;/strong&gt; or third-party network connections or incapacity of an instructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—&lt;em&gt;Force majeure&lt;/em&gt; clause 19.6 of University of Colorado Boulder contract (emphasis mine)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know if those risks are sorted in any way, but can't help but notice that &lt;em&gt;act of God&lt;/em&gt; sits right between
&lt;em&gt;labor dispute&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;failure of the Internet&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently Rees has a show on the road. The title is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/category/academia/aaup/"&gt;Educational Technology, Budgetary Priorities and Academic Freedom&lt;/a&gt;. Should be good.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>coursera</category><category>crowdsourcing</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-ii.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2014 21:16:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The academic (social) machine (part I)</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/the-academic-social-machine-part-I.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;There was recently a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/AndrewBRElliott/status/507912025599934464/photo/1"&gt;picture circulating on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, like pictures do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../why_google.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/why_google.jpg" style="width: 370.8px; height: 338.4px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is, to say the least, a skewed view of academia, although I am certainly not the best placed to say that. I tend to have a beard, use big words, have recently started blogging and did &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_dress_of_the_University_of_Oxford"&gt;wear robes at some point in my academic career&lt;/a&gt;. This is however a good opportunity to show how algorithmic bias works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, where does the bias originate here?
As I explained before in my post on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/social-teaching-machines.html"&gt;social teaching machines&lt;/a&gt;, autocompletion surfaces information collected previously. The information in this case is collected in various ways, most notably by looking at previous searches. It is difficult to make broad statements on why people make a Google search. It's an act that always occurs in a certain context, for a ton of different reasons, and Google optimises for an average that is unclear. Who else is making the same search will undoubtedly have an effect on how Google sees the context of a search. Consider the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.ch/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;amp;ei=uvERVIGPKKbC8gfCuIGQAg&amp;amp;gws_rd=ssl#q=why+do+english+people+have+british+humor"&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Why do English people have British humor?&lt;/em&gt; and its first answer: Google obviously got the context wrong in my case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;img alt="../british_humor.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/british_humor.jpg" style="width: 546.4px; height: 196.8px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a bit at a loss to say more on this, so feel free to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, some of those biases are substantially more serious, of course. For this, you simply have to enter a search of the form "Why do &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; people &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;", where &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; can be any of {&lt;em&gt;asian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;white&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;black&lt;/em&gt;} and &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; any of {&lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;smell&lt;/em&gt;} to realise that autocomplete is powerful to surface common stereotypes. Not all those autocompletes work though (presumably because the output is too vile and has been hand blocked). So we humans enter our biases, and Google actually amplifies them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see where this leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of autocompletion, the impact is certainly weak, but it might correlate with other biases (or cause them?), underscoring a more ingrained problem. Let's go back to Google's view of academia: what does the output of a Google Image Search of &lt;em&gt;academics faculty&lt;/em&gt; return?  You can try to use this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=635&amp;amp;q=academics+faculty&amp;amp;oq=academics+faculty"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, which is user agnostic (but its output will be personalized by Google once you click, unless you use privacy conscious tools). Here is the view I get, when logged in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../why_google_images.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/why_google_images.jpg" style="width: 1340.0px; height: 611.0px;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yours should be different: most probably, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao"&gt;Terence Tao&lt;/a&gt;, the short-sleeved mathematician in the middle row, is further down in yours. This is reasonable, and explained by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~csandvig/"&gt;Christian Sandvig&lt;/a&gt; in a beautiful post called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://socialmediacollective.org/2014/03/25/show-and-tell-algorithmic-culture/"&gt;Show-and-Tell: Algorithmic Culture&lt;/a&gt;: since I am a mathematician, Google gives Tao a bump &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/the-academic-social-machine-part-I.html#id2" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. And beyond that? Well, Google &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; thinks that academics wear robes half the time, and perpetuates this bias also visually, not just in autocomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this really a serious problem? Well, one consequence is that when humans need to illustrate something (a blog, an educational resource,...) it actually requires effort, judgement to accurately assess the potential bias and not succumb to it. For robes it is of course very easy. For skin color or diversity, as we know, it can be harder and thus requires training and conscious effort. In its outputs, Google is &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; already biased, in ways that are hard to assess for all of us who don't know the Google secret sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automation is moving rapidly in many areas. Online advertising could easily remove any intermediate human step, refeeding to us our own biases for commercial gain. Services like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/eletp/Projects/Sketch2Photo/"&gt;Sketch2Photo&lt;/a&gt; offer the promise of automating the illustration processes, for instance for lecture notes, which would perpetuate this same effect over more vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;

It makes the output more relevant to me. If overdone it could also lead to some form of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble"&gt;filter bubble&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</description><category>algorithmic_bias</category><category>google</category><category>social_machine</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/the-academic-social-machine-part-I.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2014 11:40:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>ašţal</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/astal.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, no language, as far as I know, has a single word for that chin-stroking moment you get, often accompanied by a frown on your face, when someone expresses an idea that you’ve never thought of and you have a moment of suddenly seeing possibilities you never saw before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what we are going for here.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/astal.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2014 10:41:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Learning, working and ?</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/learning-working-and.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of my recent thoughts have turned around issues of crowdsourcing and online education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../worklearn.jpg" class="align-right" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/worklearn.jpg" style="width: 346.4px; height: 85.6px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my co-authors (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hci.uni-hannover.de/people/markus"&gt;Markus Krause&lt;/a&gt;) is co-organising a workshop on that topic, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.worklearn.org/"&gt;WorkLearn 2014&lt;/a&gt;. It will take place in Pittsburgh November 2-4, as part of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.humancomputation.com/2014/"&gt;Human Computation conference HCOMP2014&lt;/a&gt;. Human Computation is another expression interchangeable for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/social-teaching-machines.html"&gt;social machine&lt;/a&gt;, although it has different connotations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stated motivation of the workshop is very ambitious:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online education and crowdsourcing communities are addressing similar problems in educating, motivating and evaluating students and workers. The online learning community succeeds in increasing the supply side of the cognitively skilled labor market, and the crowdsourcing at scale community creates a larger marketplace for cognitively skilled work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linking online platforms for crowd work with platforms for MOOCs has the potential to: provide knowledge and training at a massive scale to contributors; collect data that identify expert skills; engage contributors in simultaneously working and learning in a social environment; and organize large communities around online courses on specific topics. These all provide new opportunities to support and deploy sophisticated algorithms for crowd learning and work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most successful example in this direction is of course &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://duolingo.com"&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;, which helps translate the web while using volunteer labor by language learners. If one omits the learning, the strategy there is not that different from the strategy used by my Coursera coworker &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/bernstein"&gt;Abraham Bernstein&lt;/a&gt; to translate books using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk"&gt;Amazon Mechanical Turk&lt;/a&gt;, and indeed part of his efforts aim to design effective tools to program those social machines (with the programming language CrowdLang).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;embed&gt;&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/emCABRV2cUA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have always had some qualms about the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://florianschmidt.co/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/"&gt;ethics of crowdsourcing&lt;/a&gt;, even though it can clearly be used for good: the prototypical success story is in the work of Ushahidi during the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ushahidi.com/blog/2012/01/12/haiti-and-the-power-of-crowdsourcing/"&gt;2010 Haiti earthquake&lt;/a&gt;. I was thus very happy to see over Labor Day 2014 that Michael Bernstein from Stanford announced &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://crowdresearch.org/blog/?p=9039"&gt;guidelines for academic requesters on Amazon Mechanical Turk&lt;/a&gt;. He explains the rationale for this (a Turker is a worker on a crowdsourcing platform):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
An IRB-approved researcher experimented on the [crowdsourcing] platform unannounced. The result was Turker confusion, strife, and wasted time, in a system where time is what it takes to make ends meet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guidelines were themselves crowdsourced, designed together with the Turkers (it's only natural!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, over the summer, there was a huge controversy over the iffy ethics of social platforms experimentation. This is due to the release at the very end of June 2014 of a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2014/06/29/facebook-doesnt-understand-the-fuss-about-its-emotion-manipulation-study/"&gt;Facebook experiment on its users&lt;/a&gt; (don't miss the Cornell IRB flowchart there). There are a ton of links about this, but the best is probably the account by Mary L. Gray of an &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://marylgray.org/?page_id=203"&gt;ethics panel that took place at the Microsoft Research Faculty Summit&lt;/a&gt; (and unfortunately was published with much delay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, this should give serious pause to any educator. One can see lots of fields suddenly getting much too close, with very different or inexistent values. Online learners, just as Turkers, are vulnerable. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nogoodreason.typepad.co.uk/no_good_reason/2014/06/the-ethics-of-digital-scholarship.html"&gt;Martin Weller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2014/01/13/the-vulnerability-of-learning/"&gt;George Siemens&lt;/a&gt; have recently insisted on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Anyone wants to submit a position paper (2 pages) on the topic? Any of my co-learners in MOOCs would like to see what we can do? We could, well... crowdsource it...&lt;/p&gt;

In this one, I want to compare two of the big players in edtech on a narrow point, that of comment posts and their associated privacy. This is partly done in response to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/funnymonkey"&gt;Bill Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;'s posts on edtech privacy policies, but also as a concerned parent looking a bit far out in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 26th Google held an I/O developer conference. I was hoping, like many, some kind of announcement about &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mooc.org"&gt;mooc.org&lt;/a&gt;. Not much was said on that, but it was still an instructive watch of the efforts of Google in the MOOC space. I was particularly struck by a comment of Julia Wilkowski (leader in their MOOC project) following a question from the audience. The comment is at 28:35, if it does not play for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;embed&gt;&lt;iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/YCUZ01yFtsM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;p&gt;She informs us that no sophisticated analysis has been performed thus far on the Google MOOC forum posts. There are apparently two reasons: it is complicated, and they are required to delete all the posts after 60 days to comply with their privacy policy. Indeed, Google MOOCs fall under the global umbrella of the Google Privacy Policy, which seems to uniformly apply to all their products. The main reason for this number seems to be technical rather than anything else (the backup system is presumably very complex, extending all the way to physical tapes), since I couldn't find a reference to it in the Google Privacy Policy (and neither could other people, if you, well, google it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tad later, Peter Norvig talks about classifiers (similar to those used in the recent Facebook experiment that would make the news 3 or 4 days later), for instance to help determine when a student might be confused, a classic trick in intelligent tutoring systems. He immediately reminds us though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there still are a lot of privacy issues involved in what [..] information can you keep, how much can you tie the identity in the forum to the identity of the student, can you tie that to their identity someplace else, and the field as a whole has to come to grips with the privacy issues so we can share and learn what we want without violating privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="attribution"&gt;—Peter Norvig&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coursera is another big player in the market, with a rather different approach. In their Terms of Service and Privacy policy, one can find the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../forum-reuse.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/forum-reuse.jpg" style="width: 868.0px; height: 112.0px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most remarkable sentence here is: &lt;strong&gt;We also reserve the right to reuse Forum posts containing Personally Identifiable Information in future versions of the course we offer, and to enhance further course offerings.&lt;/strong&gt; This sentence is very puzzling to me. What does it mean? The only logical explanation I can offer is that Coursera plans to repopulate forums in later iterations of the course with posts from a previous run, presumably one where there was more emphasis on moderating the course. Ask a dumb question once, and it will be asked again on repeat, &lt;strong&gt;in your name&lt;/strong&gt;, in contexts you don't necessarily know. Share a bit too much of your great idea for a startup, in a context where you feel confortable, well, too bad: it might be reshared again, even if you delete your post at the end of a course (many MOOC students have the feeble illusion that this protects their intellectual property).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Terms of Service also include the following, which is classically &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.ch/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=%22Neither+the+User+Content+(as+defined+below)+on+these+Sites%2C+nor+any+links+to+other+websites%2C+are+screened%2C+moderated%2C+approved%2C+reviewed+or+endorsed%22&amp;amp;start=0"&gt;present in many platform disclaimers&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../forum-disclaimer.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/forum-disclaimer.jpg" style="width: 863.0px; height: 156.0px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Coursera Terms of Service include numerous such disturbing clauses, as detailed in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.craigbutosi.ca/blog/coursera-or-socrates-was-not-a-content-provider-the-university-of-toronto-and-coursera-agreement"&gt;this wonderful post&lt;/a&gt; from August 2012. That post is a &lt;strong&gt;very highly recommended read&lt;/strong&gt;, since it details issues of free speech and academic freedom, a hot button those days. It also includes the following gem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is crucial that we pay close attention to the fine print, something unfortunately overshadowed by the immediacy and novelty of Web 2.0 solutions and the latest trends in brand management techniques.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only recommend this approach, but it has to be moderated by a quote given earlier in the piece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Because Coursera mediates between instructor/university and user/student communication, we are dealing with at least four major relationships: user-Coursera, Coursera-instructor/university, user-Coursera-instructor/university, and vice versa. I am mainly focusing on the user-Coursera relation (terms of use and privacy policy), but it should be noted that these are really only separable at the analytical level. In reality, all of these relations are in play at any given time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves many unanswered questions, which are not easy to address. It requires access to other contracts, between the instructor, the university and Coursera itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only one such contract between a university and Coursera has been discussed on a wide scale, the contract given to the University of Michigan. It was the object of a 2012 Chronicle of Higher Education article (an antiquity in the domain of MOOCs), and is based on a Freedom of Information request for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://chronicle.com/article/Document-Examine-the-U-of/133063/"&gt;University of Michigan contracts&lt;/a&gt;.
More recently, the UCSC Faculty Union has entered negociations with Coursera, that are &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ucscfa.org/2013/06/scfas-ongoing-discussion-concerning-ucscs-contract-with-coursera/"&gt;detailed on its blog&lt;/a&gt;. From the outside, these negociations seem very one-sided and highlight differences with the University of Michigan contract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the Michigan contract, the instructor grants to COURSERA various rights FOR THE DURATION SUCH CONTENT IS OFFERED THROUGH THE PLATFORM (i.e., very limited transfer  of rights).  In our contract, in contrast, the rights are granted TO THE UNIVERSITY and this appears to be irrevocable and not connected to the hosting of the course on the Coursera  platform.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the balance of the Coursera contract shifts towards the instructor at the University of Michigan, compared to at UCSC. In the latest Shangai rankings (for the little they are worth), Michigan was ranked 22nd while UCSC was 93rd. Bear in mind that Michigan joined earlier, which might also affect this complex bargaining equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other contracts have been put online, intentionally or not, and can be found by googling titles etc. I found eight in total, which can serve as evidence of subtle shifts of the Coursera strategy, and also segmentation according to the characteristics of the universities involved (European vs. American, public vs. private, etc). Since many of those contracts are locked under Non Disclosure Agreements, and this has already become a union issue elsewhere, I can only encourage other academics to push for openness of those contracts at their own institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For a cool application of machine learning to the process of teaching, look also at the video around the 4:30 mark. Google seems to focus there on content rather than users, and to extract values from the student contributions rather than their private data. They effectively intend to crowdsource smarter compilers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I want to thank Ignacio Despujol Zabala for letting me know about this Google I/O session.)&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>coursera</category><category>edtech</category><category>google</category><category>privacy</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-i.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 Sep 2014 10:23:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>How fast the world has changed</title><link>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/how-fast-the-world-has-changed.html</link><dc:creator>Paul-Olivier Dehaye</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;As I am starting to blog, I am taking a course on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://schoolofopen.p2pu.org/"&gt;openness with P2PU&lt;/a&gt;. This is helping me think of how to quickly and most efficiently &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/3393"&gt;reclaim my domain&lt;/a&gt;. For this, I have been looking back at the few notes I have posted around on Facebook. Actually, you can too if you have a Facebook account, as I have just made them &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/paulolivier.dehaye/notes"&gt;viewable to every facebook user&lt;/a&gt;. This way, if you are new here, you can get a quick sense of what I am about. Incidentally, due to a little known item in the Facebook &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/your-info-on-fb"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;, this means that all the comments are now public as well (i.e. my friends gave the rights to their comments to Facebook, I gave the right to my original posts to Facebook, and finally Facebook decides to correlate privacy of comments to the privacy settings of the original post). I suppose every platform owner has to make lots of those decisions, which eventually shape the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, one of the notes struck me. It was just a link, actually, to a 2008 &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://warner.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/first-the-bad-news/"&gt;New York Times story&lt;/a&gt; about an unfortunate Walmart employee who was trampled to death on Black Friday. The angle is that bad things happen in the world, and sometimes this can end up on the internet, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aUwmsi6Wc0"&gt;filmed on crappy cell phone cameras&lt;/a&gt;. And then we have to tell kids about all that violence. The undertone of the piece is that we were just starting to grapple with that problem back then. A friend of mine commented and asked for my opinion. The original note is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/paul-olivier-dehaye/kids-are-scary-sometimes/103572210077"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, with a contemporary screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="../walmart.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/walmart.jpg" style="width: 629.0px; height: 307.0px;"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close to six years later, we are still facing the same problems, of course. Internet is more &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_26459616/youtube-twitter-teamed-halt-spread-beheading-video-report"&gt;violent&lt;/a&gt; and more &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2014/09/08/reddit-gives-mixed-messages-after-pulling-leaked-celebrity-photos/"&gt;invasive&lt;/a&gt; than ever. Any platform owner knows the value of good filters to curate content for its users. This content curation can be done jointly by machines and humans, leading to risks of algorithmic bias still misunderstood (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2014/08/04/the-facebook-experiment-what-it-means-for-you/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/message/the-algorithm-giveth-but-it-also-taketh-b7efad92bc1f"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;). It can also be done exclusively by humans, operating under strict rules. For both posts and comments. This is the model applied by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.metafilter.com"&gt;metafilter&lt;/a&gt;, leading to high quality output but a relatively weak business model, unfortunately &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gigaom.com/2014/05/22/if-a-high-quality-site-like-metafilter-can-be-crushed-by-google-what-hope-do-other-sites-have/"&gt;still vulnerable to algorithmic whims&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="epigraph"&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;&lt;dt&gt;So you're saying that people tried to use the economies of scale of the internet to disrupt the conventional and somewhat hidebound traditional methods and then it turns out that certain things requiring human eyeballs and judgment do not actually scale along with this stuff and the lesson is that you need to keep people in the mix in not just token ways even if this interferes with your bottom line...? I know that song!&lt;/dt&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, eight years after this Facebook note, the world still turns around. People get married, have babies, raise their children. And most people still use Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>baby</category><category>facebook</category><category>metafilter</category><category>privacy</category><category>reclaim</category><category>violence</category><category>whyopen</category><guid>http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/how-fast-the-world-has-changed.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2014 13:37:35 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
