    <p>I just finished giving my talk on <em>MOOCs as inventions: opportunities and risks</em> in Goteborg, at the <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23chals14&amp;src=typd">#chals14</a> meeting. This is a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/chals14?fref=ts">reunion of Swedish universities</a> convened by Jonas Gilbert (Chalmers University Library) to discuss MOOCs.</p>
<p>My slides are available <a class="reference external" href="goteborg-final.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the talk, I discussed the idea that MOOCs are <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine">social machines</a> put in the hands of professors (thanks to my PhD student <a class="reference external" href="http://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?id=assistenten&amp;L=&amp;key1=4144&amp;key2=&amp;key3=&amp;keySemId=">Helen Riedtmann</a> for boiling down my ideas to this simple statement), and quoted Evgeny Morozov, which I am reading at the moment.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it was much better to be last speaker of the morning, to offer a (hopefully constructive) balance to some of the other points made earlier. It also lead naturally to interesting discussions (including with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/the-president-and-vice-presidents/Pages/karin-markides-president.aspx">Karin Markides</a>, who asked me a few questions above my pay grade. It is much easier to convey these ideas offline than online, but indeed the audience is smaller and different).  Still, the digital world was interesting too: I was glad to see how Twitter added to the talk <strong>for me</strong> afterwards (something I am not used to, since very few mathematicians use Twitter), which helped me assess how my ideas were received. In a talk about MOOCs' risks and opportunities, someone immediately called me up on the risks of the opportunities, with a reference to Jaron Lanier:</p>
<center>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/chals14?src=hash">#chals14</a> The social machine; I wonder what Jaron Lanier would say about that. Read "You are not a gadget" for a critical take in this.</p>— Thommy Eriksson (@KuggenMedialab) <a href="https://twitter.com/KuggenMedialab/status/514714933813338113">September 24, 2014</a>
</blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center>
<p>Now adding this to my reading list, since in fact he seems to talk a lot about mathematics too! It was also good to meet <a class="reference external" href="http://jorg.pareigis.se/">Jorg Pareigis</a>, a fellow <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23ccourses&amp;src=typd">#ccourses participant</a>.</p>
<p>Two quick mementos for myself:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I have now traveled to the first 15 countries to constitute the European Union.</li>
<li>I have never been before in such last minute trouble with computers: still private Google Slides locked out of my account, requiring Google two-factor authentication through a dead cell phone... Literally managed to get to the slides as I was walking to the stand.</li>

    <img alt="../bernays.jpg" class="align-right" src="bernays.jpg" style="width: 177.0px; height: 237.0px;"><p>The ETH Zurich hosts every year the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gess.ethz.ch/news/pbl">Paul Bernays lectures</a>. This the type of lecture where people expect a Nobel prize winner to show up. Well, unless it is a mathematics one (the topic rotates among a few sciences), in which case it is OK if the speaker only has a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal">Fields medal</a>.</p>
<p>This year, it was the latter. The speaker was <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Voevodsky">Vladimir Voevodsky</a> from the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> in Princeton (the same institute where Einstein and many other brilliant scientists were coopted following great successes).</p>
<p>Voevodsky's initial success was in proving the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milnor_conjecture">Milnor conjecture</a>, but he hasn't stopped there. He has announced a proof of the Bloch-Kato conjecture as well, and is now working on Homotopy Type Theory.</p>
<p>This theory is tied to the foundations of mathematics. To the layman, it really asks deep questions about what mathematics is, and how mathematics is constructed and improved, both by computers and humans. In some ways, he is trying to scientifically map out mathematics, and during the talk suggested a 500 year horizon to do that (part of many bombastic and exciting claims made by very smart mathematicians, such as Thomas Hales at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJx8bFQbHsA">end of his lecture here</a>, who are willing to challenge the statu quo). Of course, one needs to start "small", and this is what Voevodsky explained in Zurich, his vision of the <em>Foundations of Mathematics</em>.</p>
<p>For this he had three times one hour, which he sensibly divided into: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vladimirias/2014_Paul_Bernays_Lectures/blob/master/2014_09_Bernays_1%20presentation.pdf?raw=true">past</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vladimirias/2014_Paul_Bernays_Lectures/blob/master/2014_09_Bernays_2%20presentation.pdf?raw=true">present</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vladimirias/2014_Paul_Bernays_Lectures/blob/master/2014_09_Bernays_3%20presentation.pdf?raw=true">future</a>.</p>
<p>I want to focus here on the "past" talk. He started it by quoting wikipedia's definition of <em>Foundations of Mathematics</em>:</p>
<img alt="../wikipedia-foundations.jpg" class="align-center" src="wikipedia-foundations.jpg" style="width: 616.5px; height: 236.0px;"><p>and highlighted that there were two parts to this definition: the <em>mathematical concepts</em> and the <em>metamathematical concepts</em> (the <em>structures that form the language</em>). He then went on to explain the presence of this dichotomy through the ages: discrete vs. continuous, pure vs. applied,  theorem vs. problem (<em>an inquiry the
answer to which is a construction of an object</em>), and eventually touched on this account of what mathematics is:</p>
<img alt="../grassmann.jpg" class="align-center" src="grassmann.jpg" style="width: 617.5px; height: 308.5px;"><p>Voevodsky's interpretation of what Grassmann is saying is thus: <strong>mathematics is seen as rising from many independent roots and acquiring wholeness only through the intertwining of the lines arising from these roots</strong>.</p>

    <p>Scholarship of the XXIst century will include a lot of research on teaching, learning, and citizen science. MOOCs offer fantastic opportunities in this area. The XXIst century should also probably include scholarship of its own labor practices, or at least some concerted effort to stay afloat of developments in the profession. Asymmetric information can hurt badly in negociations. For this reason, it could be helpful to gather all <strong>Coursera Framework Agreements</strong> that have landed on the internet (so far) in one place. Those agreements bind the university administration and Coursera, and package within them the actual contract to be signed later by the instructor (and guests), both with the administration and with Coursera. On top, any user of Coursera requires an account which is bound by its own Terms of Service <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/coursera-contracts-of-stony-brook-roma-unc-colorado-kentucky-michigan-utoronto-ucsc.html#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>By simply googling around (mostly for <em>Coursera Framework Agreement</em>), I was able to find the following eight contracts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-Colorado.pdf">U Colorado</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-Kentucky.pdf">U Kentucky</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-Michigan.pdf">University of Michigan</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-Roma.pdf">University of Roma (Sapienza)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-Stony_Brook.pdf">University of Stony Brook</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-UCSC.pdf">UC Santa Cruz</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-UNC.pdf">University of North Carolina</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-UToronto.pdf">University of Toronto</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Not all of those are signed, some are just preliminary and might not match the final version.
Some of those were originally obtained through Freedom of Information requests, while others were obviously misplaced. Some seem to have been removed from the web since, so I put them back here. <strong>The more interesting aspects here are the subtle variations between these contracts</strong>.</p>
<p>Should you have one that you want to share, feel free to send it to me.</p>
<p>I also include the following <a class="reference external" href="coursera-UNC-CDA.pdf">Course Development Agreement</a> for UNC. This contract is packaged within the Framework Agreement, and one is signed for each course at UNC, according to the CFA. It is relatively short, but refers to external guidelines located on the Coursera Partner Portal (i.e. online, inaccessible without an account with different permissions than a regular student account).</p>
<p>It includes the rollout policy for a particular course: 1.d.i and 1.d.ii dictate that the content should be uploaded one month ahead of the course start for the first week of content, and two weeks ahead for the second week, but "<em>[these] will not apply to the University Courses beginning in the Fall of 2013 if the achievement of these requirements is not practical or not feasible</em>". UNC <a class="reference external" href="http://gazette.unc.edu/2013/02/26/unc-to-offer-moocs-with-coursera/">joined Coursera</a> on February 2013.</p>
<p>The CDA also includes the following:</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>
<strong>Course reusability</strong>: Ensuring that the content can be easily reused in <strong>subsequent offerings of the course for which the instructor might not be involved</strong>. This includes:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Avoiding references to particular dates in lecture videos (e.g., "The homework will be due next Monday, March 4" or "It’s a beautiful summer day today");</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> After the first offering of the course, <strong>systematically editing/removing references to dates and episodes that are specific to the first offering of the course</strong> (e.g., an announcement about correcting a typo on the final exam, or about extending due dates because of Hurricane Sandy), as well as references to activities for which instructor involvement is necessary (e.g., "We hope to see you at the next live Google+ Hangout").</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="attribution">—Coursera Development Agreement, to be signed by Coursera instructors at UNC (emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have read through quite a lot of this, so if you have any question feel free to ask!</p>

    <p>For the first post in my series on edtech privacy policies, terms of service and contracts, click <a class="reference external" href="posts/edtech-policies-part-i.rst">here</a>.</p>
<p>In his recent post <em>You are not alone</em> on the Salaita affair, Jonathan Rees <a class="reference external" href="http://academeblog.org/2014/09/08/you-are-not-alone/">comments on the social media policies</a> enacted at the Colorado, Kentucky and New Mexico state systems. He encourages other professors to speak up:</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>Few of us can be sure whether or not our campus is really the canary in the higher education coal mine. However, better mine safety everywhere eventually benefits everyone with a pick and shovel. The more we professors talk to each other, both on social media and off, the better off we’ll all be when bad ideas surface that may someday affect us all.</p>
<p class="attribution">—Jonathan Rees</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evocation of the canary is very beautiful. It resonates quite a bit: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a> was after all founded to help the Swiss develop their own railway systems. In any case, looking back at his writing, Rees has really dug in the Coursera <a class="reference external" href="http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/dear-superprofessors-your-labor-has-value/">labor</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/09/03/unbundle-yourself/">practices</a>. This seems like a good opportunity to continue my <a class="reference external" href="posts/edtech-policies-part-i.html">edtech policies series</a>.</p>
<p>After some googling, one can easily find the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.colorado.edu/bfa/INITIATIVES/CourseraK2013.pdf">Coursera Framework Agreement</a> between <em>Coursera Inc., a Delaware corporation [..] and the Board of Regents of the University of Colorado [..] for the benefit of the University of Colorado Boulder</em>.</p>
<img alt="../colorado-google.jpg" class="align-center" src="colorado-google.jpg" style="width: 545.0px; height: 123.0px;"><p>Independently of any stereotype that as an academic <a class="reference external" href="posts/the-academic-social-machine-part-I.html">I hate capitalism</a>, another stereotype could be that I also quite like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/paul-olivier-dehaye/insane-travel-insurance-policy/228313430077">to read contracts</a>. Of course this one makes for a particularly interesting read: it is supposed to hint at how MOOCs will be sustainable for the UC system and how Coursera, Inc. will outlast its <a class="reference external" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coursera">85M dollars "gifts" from venture capital</a>.</p>
<p>The contract details the various rights and obligations of the parties involved, the different Coursera monetization strategies (ten instead of the eight like in the <a class="reference external" href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/400864/coursera-fully-executed-agreement.pdf">2012 Michigan contract</a>), the Course Acceptance Procedures, the responsibility of the <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/72903326640/introducing-the-2014-rotation-of-courseras-university">University Advisory Board</a> when things go wrong, etc. Of particular interest to me is how it already packages in Exhibit G-1 the relationship between an instructor and the university.</p>
<p>It also includes the following gem:</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>I hereby release, discharge, and promise not to sue Company and its affiliates, successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, demands, costs and/or causes of actions of any nature arising out of or in connection with the exercise of any rights herein granted, including, without limitation, any claim for infringement, right of publicity, libel, slander, defamation, moral rights, invasion of privacy or violation of any other rights relating to any Content I upload, share or otherwise provide in connection with use of the Platform.</p>
<p class="attribution">—Exhibit G-1, Form of Agreement for Instructors and Guest Presenters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, IANAL but once the instructor signs this, s/he is giving free pass to Coursera for any libel, slander, defamation, invasion of privacy etc against her/himself. I don't know the backstory on how the faculty at Colorado accepted this, but would be very interested. At UCSC, the collective bargaining chapter has on the other hand been <a class="reference external" href="http://ucscfa.org/2013/06/scfas-ongoing-discussion-concerning-ucscs-contract-with-coursera/">very critical</a>, as has been discussed in <a class="reference external" href="posts/edtech-policies-part-i.html">part I</a> of this series.</p>
<p>Rees' words on this are very apt, to his credit a year ago already:</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>At some point you have to realize that you do not work in a vacuum. Teaching a MOOC or not teaching a MOOC, speaking out in favor of them or remaining silent – these things all have an effect on the rest of your profession. You can’t just declare that MOOCs are the future and let the chips fall where they may. You have the ability to influence what kind of future we’ll all face.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Can we guess what XXIst century education might guarantee in terms of labor rights? Is there an online strike clause in any of them? All I could find is called <em>Force Majeure</em>:</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>Each party is excused from performance of this Agreement (other than for any payments due) and will not be liable for any delay in whole or in part caused by the occurrence of any contigency beyond the reasonable control of such Party. These contigencies include, without limitation, war, sabotage, insurrection, riot or other acts of civil disobedience, act of public enemy, failure or delay in transportation, act of government or any agency or subdivision thereof affecting the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, judicial action, <strong>labor dispute</strong>, student disorders, accident, fire, explosion, flood, severe weather, natural disaster or other <strong>act of God</strong>, shortage of labor, hardware failure, interruptions or <strong>failure of the Internet</strong> or third-party network connections or incapacity of an instructor.</p>
<p class="attribution">—<em>Force majeure</em> clause 19.6 of University of Colorado Boulder contract (emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>

    <p>There was recently a <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/AndrewBRElliott/status/507912025599934464/photo/1">picture circulating on Twitter</a>, like pictures do.</p>
<img alt="../why_google.jpg" class="align-center" src="why_google.jpg" style="width: 370.8px; height: 338.4px;"><br><p>This is, to say the least, a skewed view of academia, although I am certainly not the best placed to say that. I tend to have a beard, use big words, have recently started blogging and did <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_dress_of_the_University_of_Oxford">wear robes at some point in my academic career</a>. This is however a good opportunity to show how algorithmic bias works.</p>
<p>First off, where does the bias originate here?
As I explained before in my post on <a class="reference external" href="posts/social-teaching-machines.html">social teaching machines</a>, autocompletion surfaces information collected previously. The information in this case is collected in various ways, most notably by looking at previous searches. It is difficult to make broad statements on why people make a Google search. It's an act that always occurs in a certain context, for a ton of different reasons, and Google optimises for an average that is unclear. Who else is making the same search will undoubtedly have an effect on how Google sees the context of a search. Consider the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.ch/?gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=uvERVIGPKKbC8gfCuIGQAg&amp;gws_rd=ssl#q=why+do+english+people+have+british+humor">search</a> <em>Why do English people have British humor?</em> and its first answer: Google obviously got the context wrong in my case.</p>
<br><img alt="../british_humor.jpg" class="align-center" src="british_humor.jpg" style="width: 546.4px; height: 196.8px;"><br><p>I am a bit at a loss to say more on this, so feel free to comment.</p>
<p>In any case, some of those biases are substantially more serious, of course. For this, you simply have to enter a search of the form "Why do <strong>A</strong> people <strong>B</strong>", where <strong>A</strong> can be any of {<em>asian</em>, <em>white</em>, <em>black</em>} and <strong>B</strong> any of {<em>look</em>, <em>like</em> <em>smell</em>} to realise that autocomplete is powerful to surface common stereotypes. Not all those autocompletes work though (presumably because the output is too vile and has been hand blocked). So we humans enter our biases, and Google actually amplifies them.</p>
<p>Let's see where this leads.</p>
<p>In the case of autocompletion, the impact is certainly weak, but it might correlate with other biases (or cause them?), underscoring a more ingrained problem. Let's go back to Google's view of academia: what does the output of a Google Image Search of <em>academics faculty</em> return?  You can try to use this <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=635&amp;q=academics+faculty&amp;oq=academics+faculty">link</a>, which is user agnostic (but its output will be personalized by Google once you click, unless you use privacy conscious tools). Here is the view I get, when logged in:</p>
<img alt="../why_google_images.jpg" class="align-center" src="why_google_images.jpg" style="width: 1340.0px; height: 611.0px;"><br><br><p>Yours should be different: most probably, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao">Terence Tao</a>, the short-sleeved mathematician in the middle row, is further down in yours. This is reasonable, and explained by <a class="reference external" href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~csandvig/">Christian Sandvig</a> in a beautiful post called <a class="reference external" href="http://socialmediacollective.org/2014/03/25/show-and-tell-algorithmic-culture/">Show-and-Tell: Algorithmic Culture</a>: since I am a mathematician, Google gives Tao a bump <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/the-academic-social-machine-part-I.html#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>. And beyond that? Well, Google <em>really</em> thinks that academics wear robes half the time, and perpetuates this bias also visually, not just in autocomplete.</p>
<p>Is this really a serious problem? Well, one consequence is that when humans need to illustrate something (a blog, an educational resource,...) it actually requires effort, judgement to accurately assess the potential bias and not succumb to it. For robes it is of course very easy. For skin color or diversity, as we know, it can be harder and thus requires training and conscious effort. In its outputs, Google is <em>potentially</em> already biased, in ways that are hard to assess for all of us who don't know the Google secret sauce.</p>
<p>Automation is moving rapidly in many areas. Online advertising could easily remove any intermediate human step, refeeding to us our own biases for commercial gain. Services like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/eletp/Projects/Sketch2Photo/">Sketch2Photo</a> offer the promise of automating the illustration processes, for instance for lecture notes, which would perpetuate this same effect over more vulnerable populations.</p>
