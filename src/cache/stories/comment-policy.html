<p>On my blog, I want to encourage free discussion around ideas and facts (including those that are inconvenient to political groups, authorities, friends or others that I am sympathetic to). This, of course, is an ideal that is hard to achieve.</p>
<p>As you see, this is a very similar definition to that of academic freedom (in fact, it is lifted from wikipedia).</p>
<p>For this reason, should I think that your comment needs to be deleted, I will do so and add a quote previously used by a university administrator to refine academic freedom at their own institution.</p>
