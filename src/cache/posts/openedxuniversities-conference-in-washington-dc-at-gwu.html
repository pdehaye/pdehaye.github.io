<p>On November 11 2015, I gave a talk at the OpenEdX Universities conference at George Washington University in Washington DC. The tile was &quot;Educators as pathetic dots -- Why we need collaborative models in education&quot;.</p>
<p>The talk was filmed. You can access it as a dual video stream <a class="reference external" href="http://go.gwu.edu/openedx">here</a> (Session 4), or below as an embedded YouTube of just the slides (first 30 minutes or so).</p>
