<p>On November 11 2015, I gave a talk at the OpenEdX Universities conference at George Washington University in Washington DC. The tile was &quot;Educators as pathetic dots -- Why we need collaborative models in education&quot;.</p>
<p>The talk was filmed, here is a stream of the slides (separate stream of me talking to follow).</p>
