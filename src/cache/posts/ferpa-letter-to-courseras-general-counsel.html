<br><p>I have written the following letter to Coursera's General Counsel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>March 20, 2015</p>
<p>Dear Mr Liu,</p>
<p>I am contacting you since you are General Counsel of Coursera. I would like to get access to the entirety of my record as a student on Coursera.</p>
<p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1232g) mandates that students should get access to a copy of all their educational records. This includes any emails e-mails, notes, memoranda, video, audio, or other documentary material maintained by the educational institution. FERPA also prohibits the imposition of a fee to review documents (per 34 CFR Sec. 99.11(b)).</p>
<p>I am aware that Coursera does not believe it is subject to FERPA. Note however that</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>its Terms of Service refer explicity to &quot;students&quot; [1];</li>
<li>that the vocabulary shift from &quot;student&quot; to &quot;learner&quot; by Coursera employees occured after I signed up for the platform;</li>
<li>Vivek Goel, at the time Coursera's Chief Academic Strategist, said to the Chronicle of Higher Education that the company followed the &quot;principles&quot; of FERPA when handling the data of its users [2].</li>
</ul>
<p>Of particular interest to me is information about any of my posts that might have been deleted or silent-banned. By silent-banning I refer to the practice of flagging a forum post, in such a way that</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the post is still visible to the original poster;</li>
<li>the post is invisible to anyone else;</li>
<li>it is invisible to the original poster that his/her post has been flagged in that way.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know the practice is common on some online forums, but I am hard pressed to find a face-to-face equivalent of that type of situation in a classroom, or why it would be justified in a learning environment (except to reduce TA labor costs). It obviously raises significant free speech issues if suddenly people's speech can be limited in such non-transparent ways.</p>
<p>In particular, I know of two instances where this happened and as part of this FERPA request would like to get access to all relevant records so I can understand the reasoning and timing behind these silent bans. In one case presumably the ban was imposed by one of your contractors (who is also a professor at a US institution), while in another it was presumably done by one of your employees.</p>
<p>If you choose to redact any portion of any documents responsive to this request, please provide a written explanation for the redaction including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) upon which you rely. Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.</p>
<p>As per 34 CFR Sec. 99.10(b), these records must be made available for my inspection within 45 days of this request.</p>
<p>I look forward to receiving a full response within 45 calendar days.</p>
