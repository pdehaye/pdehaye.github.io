<p>Summer runs from the third week of June to the third week of September. Usually academics relax over the summer, attend conferences, etc. I haven't, and learned a lot in the process. Somehow this period for me fits precisely in that summer timeframe, so it is a good time to reflect. Here is (a little of) what I learned, along with my best effort to place those moments on a timeline. Some of the items below link to tweets, blog posts and news articles. This post itself will be updated with more explicit links to new blog posts, if needed.</p>

<li>June 26th--. Trust issues can be very very difficult to navigate online, especially in a teaching context (reaffirmed multiple times over the summer, looking forward to #ccourses week on the topic)</li>
<li>June 28th. It's good to listen to your partner and friends, and take breaks.</li>
<li>June 28th. Facebook has manipulated users' emotions.</li>
<li>June 29th--30th. A huge area of social science is apparently completely uncharted territory.</li>
<li>June 30th. A risky plan becomes outward dangerous when a monkey wrech is thrown at it.</li>
<li>June 30th. It is not always wise to take even more risks as a response.</li>
<li>July 3rd. Make sure to consult your allies.</li>
<li>July 4th--5th. Wow. Institutions definitely mess up sometimes.</li>
<li>July 5th--. The fallout can be more revealing than anything else (throughout the summer).</li>
<li>July 7th. Sometimes, I can be</li>
<li>July 18th. I can be incredibly naive sometimes. The law is above all else.</li>
<li>July 4th--September ??th. Sometimes risks don't work out, what matters is how those are dealt with.</li>
<li>July 8th Justin Reich  -- Asilomar convention</li>
<li>July  th. Steve Volovich thinks that there is value in confusion for teaching.</li>

<p>UIUC has exploited the legally weak situation they have themselves imposed on one of their new hires to rescind a hiring, based on a very short evaluation by the Board of Trustees.</p>
<p>MIT has interned one academic because of his views (allegedly, according to the academic, who is not free to explain his point of view right now).</p>
