<p>The European Union and Switzerland have agreements on free trade with the United States. One of those is Safe Harbour, which has drastic implication for privacy <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id1">[1]</a>. In principle, Safe Harbour is a good idea: it creates little (business) friction but ensures some form of citizen oversight over the fastest evolving areas of e-commerce, by enforcing transparency. It is being heavily tested though: in light of the Snowden revelations, there is growing understanding that this data originally held for commercial reasons is also a leverage of power. Andrus Ansip, the European Commissioner for Digital Single Market (designate)  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.euractiv.com/sections/innovation-enterprise/ansip-threatens-suspend-safe-harbour-data-agreement-us-308962">acknowledged</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/europe-digital-nominee-demands-stronger-u-s-data-rules/">this</a> in his hearings to be confirmed.</p>

<p>The developments around <strong>MOOCs have very serious consequences for privacy</strong>. Dozens of European universities are working with US MOOC companies, spending lots, and ultimately contributing to data collection on millions of young EU citizens, all without clear purposes. There is very different cultural understanding across the Atlantic of the privacy protections of the relationships between platform and user, teacher and student and university and student. There are also very delicate (legal) constructions everywhere of what constitutes academic freedom.</p>
<p>All these ideas were extensively tested when I taught the class <em>Teaching goes massive: new skills required</em> on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/massiveteaching">Coursera</a>. Parts of this class were supposed to cover some of those issues, and explain directly to the students most concerned the privacy issues associated to Coursera's business models. Instead, I was <strong>censored</strong>, <strong>insulted</strong>, <strong>vilified</strong> and <strong>legally threatened</strong>, and Coursera used <strong>false, misleading or deeply intrusive</strong> data held about the course or me to get my employer to launch a disciplinary procedure against me (as even <a class="reference external" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/07/15/after-massiveteaching-questions-about-mooc-quality-control">hinted to a newspaper</a>!). On top, of course, my students have been left in the dark. And I have lost access to my course materials.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Safe Harbour is a recourse here for me. I have submitted a request to Coursera, if only to get back access to the material created.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Ansip has decided to follow a suggestion of <a class="reference external" href="https://juliareda.eu/en/">Julia Reda</a>, a Pirate Party MEP, and host an online town hall meeting as well.</p>

The solution found with Safe Harbour is to at least ensure transparency: any European citizen can ask to consult their data, what it is used for, etc. The situation was different a few years ago: I had to wait for Facebook to set up European Headquartes in Ireland to ask for access to my data.</td></tr>
