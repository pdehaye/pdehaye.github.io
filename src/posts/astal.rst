.. epigraph ::

    Well, no language, as far as I know, has a single word for that chin-stroking moment you get, often accompanied by a frown on your face, when someone expresses an idea that you’ve never thought of and you have a moment of suddenly seeing possibilities you never saw before.
    
    In Ithkuil, it’s ašţal.

That's what we are going for here.
