On November 11 2015, I gave a talk at the OpenEdX Universities conference at George Washington University in Washington DC. The tile was "Educators as pathetic dots -- Why we need collaborative models in education".

The talk was filmed. You can access it as a dual video stream `here <http://go.gwu.edu/openedx>`_ (Session 4), or below as an embedded YouTube of just the slides (first 30 minutes or so).
