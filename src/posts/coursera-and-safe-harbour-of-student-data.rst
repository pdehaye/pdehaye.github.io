The European Union and Switzerland have agreements on free trade with the United States. One of those is Safe Harbour, which has drastic implication for privacy [1]_. In principle, Safe Harbour is a good idea: it creates little (business) friction but ensures some form of citizen oversight over the fastest evolving areas of e-commerce, by enforcing transparency. It is being heavily tested though: in light of the Snowden revelations, there is growing understanding that this data originally held for commercial reasons is also a leverage of power. Andrus Ansip, the European Commissioner for Digital Single Market (designate)  `acknowledged <http://www.euractiv.com/sections/innovation-enterprise/ansip-threatens-suspend-safe-harbour-data-agreement-us-308962>`_ `this <http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/europe-digital-nominee-demands-stronger-u-s-data-rules/>`_ in his hearings to be confirmed.




.. [1] Let's say a US company wants to do business in the EU. The EU, well aware of dangers associated with big data businesses, is concerned about the privacy of its citizens. At the same time, it does not want to hamper innovation. The solution found with Safe Harbour is to at least ensure transparency: any European citizen can ask to consult their data, what it is used for, etc. The situation was different a few years ago: I had to wait for Facebook to set up European Headquartes in Ireland to ask for access to my data.

.. [2] Ansip is also former Prime Minister of Estonia, a country very much ahead in everything digital. One can even `become e-citizen there and get digital residency <http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/estonia-first-country-offer-e-residency-digital-citizenship-1468766>`_, with minimal requirements.

.. [3] Not very promising actually: within a few minutes of my original email, I got a canned message back sending me to assistance forums. I replied that this was not an answer to my request, and got the same canned message once again... Possibly I am the first Coursera user to make use of Safe Harbour.
