There was this week some coverage in the news of privacy issues in MOOCs, particularly around the startup Coursera. 

- In the `German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung <http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/online-universitaeten-der-glaeserne-student-1.2762465>`_, `English version <http://international.sueddeutsche.de/post/134976683720/moocs-and-privacy-german-fears-about-online>`_
- In the `German website Tagesschau <https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/moocs-113.html>`_
- In the `German website Bayerischer Rundfunk <http://www.br.de/themen/ratgeber/inhalt/computer/moocs-datenschutz-usa-100.html>`_ (a copy of previous one)
- On the `German TV station Das Erste <http://www.daserste.de/information/politik-weltgeschehen/mittagsmagazin/sendung/moocs-uni-professor-kurs-vorlesung-online-datenschutz-usa-safe-harbor-100.htmlc>`_
- On `Swiss radio SR4 <http://www.srf.ch/sendungen/srf-4-aktuell/online-studium-richtige-psychoprofile-werden-erstellt>`_
- An article in Zeit Online that I lost track of.

The journalists asked a data protection official of a Lander in Germany and of the Canton of Zurich, who confirmed that Coursera could do anything they want with the data collected.

I was most surprised by how tone deaf the Munich academic was at those concerns. Then I saw that he is a professor of computer science and economics. From my experience discussing with dozens of professors about MOOCs, this is definitely a `two-culture issue <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures>`_, with the CS people at one end of the spectrum. (update: judging from the response of the vice-rector of the University of Zurich, a jurist, there goes my theory...)

Of course privacy is a very narrow framing of the issues that MOOC platforms raise, particularly when they are based in the US. For a quick recap, you can consult a `Storify <https://storify.com/podehaye/challenges-presented-by-moocs-outside-of-the-educa>`_ I made a while back, or if you have more time `watch for instance my talk <openedxuniversities-conference-in-washington-dc-at-gwu.html>`_ in DC from a few weeks ago.
