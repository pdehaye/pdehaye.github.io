In case it is not clear at this stage, I still have a score to settle with Coursera, but I try to be a patient man. 

    If someone’s not going to follow the practices, that’s something that society faces in general, and that’s why we have police and courts [..] In the academic world, we don’t need police and courts, but we have academic discipline, we have academic institutional standards, we have research standards. If people don’t comply with those, they do need to be deal[t] with. In our set of relationships, that’s between the university and the instructor.

Goel is textually correct of course. But he is also intentionally misleading (by offering this generic quote in an article about a course that I ran). And he is also unintentionally short-sighted, for very many reasons. One is that he indeed reminds me of looking up the local rules.

    The University of Zurich (UZH) is an institution with a strong commitment to the free and open pursuit of scholarship.

    Scholarship is the acquisition, the advancement and the **dissemination of knowledge in a methodological and critical manner**.

    To flourish, scholarship must be **free from external influences, constraints and ideological pressures**. The University of Zurich is committed to **unrestricted freedom in research and teaching**.

    Academic freedom calls for a high degree of responsibility, including **reflection on the ethical implications of research activities for humans, animals and the environment**.

Another is that he has resorted to using innuendos. I can use my own too. 

    We see all the platforms now really starting to talk about the social aspects [..] of learning, which come from the other theories.

Don't worry, the nickname is based on `actual data <http://youtu.be/PCV5xBPoxnE?t=4m47s>`_.
