    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p>(This post is meant to be an account what happened in the Coursera course <em>Massive Teaching: New skills required</em>. I suggest reading the <a class="reference external" href="posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html">previous post</a> first. This honors my commitment to trying to get the truth to my students)</p>
<div class="section" id="why-the-course">
<h2>Why the course?</h2>
<p>I do believe that MOOCs offer many opportunities. Beyond providing educational material at a very large scale, they might for instance also help strengthen democracy or enable new discoveries. I have <a class="reference external" href="posts/mooc-research-proposal-using-crowdsourcing.html">submitted a grant proposal along those lines</a>. Since utopian ideas often get compromised and ultimately shaped by commercial interests, I started in May 2013 to take a closer look at contracts between MOOC providers and educational institutions. Coursera was a natural choice for my focus: my university has partnered with them, they use closed source software (which increases lock-in), and they are the leading MOOC provider right now.</p>
<p>What I read really bothered me, for a wide array of reasons. While the utopian vision of MOOCs (free-education-for-all) is compelling, these contracts reflect a very disturbing approach to that goal. In my opinion these contracts will have large societal implications, should they become the norm: disappearance of academic freedom, of the free agency of students, and complete disappearance of any form of privacy when learning. When I tried to communicate this around me, I encountered a clear lack of information on the subject. Getting past the utopian vision took time. Once there, many responded that my concerns were valid and worth discussing. In any case, this approach was ineffective: MOOC partnership decisions are often made by university administrations, based on factors other than those that drove my concerns.</p>
<p>I decided that the best way to proceed was to teach a MOOC on the topic. The most natural place to do so was of course Coursera, and it also seemed natural to address the course to professors, i.e. individuals who might be able to affect decisions at their own institutions or in their local communities. It would also allow me to reach out to the more "typical" Coursera students and explain to them the contracts that are constructed around their learning. Finally, I thought it would be interesting to see the capacities at Coursera to reflect on their own practices.</p>
<p>I understand the paradox of teaching on Coursera about concerns relating to teaching on Coursera, but made the calculation that the benefits outweigh the costs in this case.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="timeline-of-preparation-and-structure-of-the-course">
<h2>Timeline of preparation and structure of the course</h2>
<p>The course was approved by Coursera mid-April. The Quality Assurance Protocol at Coursera requires the first two weeks of material to be uploaded ahead of the beginning of the course. The third week (and later) can be uploaded at the last minute.</p>
<p>In consequence, I structured the course <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xnBH0JDaU8">in the following way</a>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>week 1: pedagogy</li>
<li>week 2: technology and copyright</li>
<li>week 3: business model, science fiction (utopia/dystopia), unresolved questions</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the first two weeks were conceived to provide background for the third week, which would be quite critical of MOOC contracts. I didn't hide from Coursera or the students that I would be critical, and used the flexibility offered by Coursera not to provide the third week material ahead of time. There were several reasons for this:
- The MOOC world changes fast. In the three weeks before the course started, two comprehensive reports came out on MOOCs. I also <a class="reference external" href="posts/what-i-am-doing-with-moocs-and-why-june-2nd.html">attended two conferences on MOOCs, and was co-organiser of one</a>.
- I knew there was a risk that Coursera would shut down the course, either directly or indirectly. Coursera did drag their feet more and more in the lead up to the course. I attribute that to the realisation of the extent of what I wanted to say, but they could easily chalk it to other reasons.</p>
<p>I conceived simple videos to illustrate concepts (like an illustrated glossary), but did not mean for this to constitute the whole course. The videos would be accompanied by readings and forum interactions. Of course, I recognised that students could still desire different levels of interactions, and I was fine with this diversity. Also, this course was meant to be <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xnBH0JDaU8">very responsive to evolutions in the MOOC world in its later runs</a>, which explains why the videos are relatively condensed and interchangeable.</p>
<p>Because of the openness of the topic, I tried as much as possible not to give the impression of a "full course". This meant that it did not deliver either a Statement of Accomplishment or a Verified Certificate. Due to the Coursera contracts, I was still required to deliver a numerical grade at the end (which couldn't be 0% for all or 100% for all). I tentatively settled for a bland peer-feedback assessment, as I thought this would be more useful than a multiple choice quiz.</p>
<p>In addition, I prepared some "experiments" through the course forums. The term is very confusing: these were not scientific or social experiments, but clearly advertised and explained attempts to talk with the students, get the students to engage with the content and interact with each other and advance the state-of-the-art in collaborative tools in MOOCs. Unfortunately I have now lost electronic access to the course material itself, so I cannot relay the exact wording used to explain this to the students.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="first-week-of-the-course">
<h2>First week of the course</h2>
<p>The first week of the course went according to me quite well, although it was exhausting: I interacted and welcomed dozens of students on the forum, orientated them, etc.</p>
<p>In addition, I participated with the students in the "experiments" that I had prepared:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I had defined a process to manage the forums based on their preferences (like <a class="reference external" href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/">Area 51 on Stack Exchange</a>), but this had to be scrapped (lack of interest) and turned instead into a listing of desired features in forums;</li>
<li>One student initiated a wide survey of MOOC students by MOOC students, that I encouraged;</li>
<li>I decided to attempt to build a badging system (Open Badges is an infrastructure that allows the cryptographically secure attribution of rewards for contributions and achievements, however small or big). This was done in response to Coursera's requirement for a grade, and because I thought it would be very effective at shifting power towards the students/professors relationship rather than the universities/MOOC platforms. In my mind these badges would be based around the forums, and aim to make the final outcome more meaningful to each individual student (via student-defined badges granted through peer-feedback and certified by the instructor). This could have been achieved in this iteration or more realistically in a later iteration of the course, based on interactions already happening in the first run. In any case, this required looking a bit deeper into the kind of data collected on students (or at least the fraction of that data that was accessible to me as an instructor). To give an example, I would need to be able to see how an upvote was encoded, and whether there would be a way to retrieve useful information from that. I asked Coursera for an anonymized database dump taken <em>before</em> the course properly started, with some forums seeded with test data (generated by me and another instructor account). When I asked to share parts of this dump with the students (even in a sanitized version with synthetic data), in the interest of transparency, it was refused. Throughout Coursera dragged their feet, which only encouraged me to dig deeper: I was also forbidden to share the supporting documentation PDFs, and my request to share those refusal emails with the students was never answered.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the first week, some students also started Facebook and Google Plus groups associated to the course, unprompted.</p>
<p>From the start of the course, I also used confusion as a teaching tool, by sometimes acting a bit randomly but in non obtrusive ways. This was done to expose hidden assumptions, and incite reactions, which in a MOOC would be numerous and were likely to be contradictory and diverse. I saw this as conducive to questioning of the instructor himself (i.e. me, an individual having signed contracts unknown to the students) and therefore to exploratory learning, especially with my intended audience of professors. I realise this is quite bold, but I merely saw this as an extreme transposition to the web of the Socratic method. Since this concerned purely my teaching methods and did not involve any research component, I did not make a formal announcement about this, but was overt at the start, for instance by opening a thread with title "?". This lead one student to answer 42, then another to give an equation. Other students wrote poems.</p>
<p>I would love to debate the value of this technique, particularly when the goal is partly to push students to turn a critical eye towards an opaque and complex legal and technical construction such as Coursera, under various restrictions on the content. Bear also in mind that students were at any point free to leave. Some certainly did but many stayed. I was also hoping that the combinatorics of the peer-feedback exercise at the end would tie loose ends at scale and cement the efficacy of the technique (since it is my suspicion that a comment such as "I am still confused by..." is more likely to elicit constructive responses from peers than "I assert this and that...").</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="second-week-of-the-course">
<h2>Second week of the course</h2>
<p>Social aspects of learning are currently completely unstructured and relatively weak on MOOC platforms, so a natural next step for them is to build some form of social network for students. Whatever form it takes (decentralised around each course, for instance), it will require extensive research unlikely to be done by the university partners since it will be core to the MOOC platforms. Concerning research practices, Facebook and Coursera have very similar, open-ended, Terms of Use.</p>
<p>During the first weekend of the course (June 29th?), the Facebook Emotion study made news: Facebook had manipulated the newsfeeds of many users, trying to selectively induce either happiness or sadness. The news coverage was extremely confusing: many academics were outraged at the lack of IRB approval, while others were unsurprised at these commercial practices.</p>
<p>Having read Coursera Terms of Use, I knew right away that similar abuses could take place there, and had many reasons to think not enough safeguards were in place at Coursera either. I very quickly saw the <a class="reference external" href="posts/erosion-of-thick-legitimacy-by-coursera.html">pernicious threat that Coursera's business model and practices represent to the thick legitimacy of instructors, researchers and universities</a>, and ultimately to society.</p>
<p>Over and above this, I knew that data collected on the Coursera platform has no expiration date, can be replayed at will and that it had not been welcoming of my own transparency effort. In that sense, there was a more immediate concern, towards my students.</p>
<p>Unlike all the material I had prepared for week 3, which was researched and based on documents available to the general public (i.e. not derived from the Quality Assurance process, the Coursera Partners' Portal or private communication), any comment of mine linking ethics of experimenting at Coursera to ethics of experimenting at Facebook would have to be speculative at the time. Making this speculation public would expose me to the risk of a legal challenge. Continuing the course would put more ethical responsibility on me since I could not be fully transparent with the students, as I had been thus far. To add to all of this, all the unresolved ethical questions led me to question the wisdom of implementing the badging experimentation within Coursera itself.</p>
<p>I started questioning the ethics of delivering a course in those conditions. I could not escape thinking along the lines of nested Stanford Experiment (Should I promote some students to Community TA? What are the other 599 courses doing?). Whatever I could think of doing I somehow could find a darker side as well, associating it to one of the studies that I had read in preparing the course. I became confused, but at a much deeper level: under all these adverse conditions, I should probably have decided to stop the course, even if doing so exposed me to legal risk. Instead, I pressed on, and resolved to deliver the rest of the course via Twitter and Youtube instead (while the willing students would support each other through the Facebook and Google Plus groups as well). I made no decision about the third week peer-feedback exam. Of course, in doing all this, I also confused the students to this much deeper level.</p>
<p>For somewhere between 24 and 48 hours, I improvised and set out to prepare material on Twitter to support my upcoming explanations. Some of it was also intentionally confounding, likely to be misunderstood by anyone who was not involved in the course, but easily explainable with the proper context (Coursera repeatedly ignored requests to engage with me in a more public way within the course). In my (poor) judgement, confusion could be used to expose hidden assumptions through reactions of other parties. For instance, I knew this might lead Coursera to stop the course, which was fine with me.</p>
<p>Another "subtext" of my tweets was the risk of <a class="reference external" href="http://socialmediacollective.org/2014/06/26/corrupt-personalization/">corrupt personalisation</a> (June 26th) in teaching, originating from <a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/niftyc/archives/975">algorithmic culture</a>. I thought it would be interesting to show this to students, centered around the World Cup taking place at the same time (Twitter, for the duration of the World Cup, offered the opportunity to do your own A/B testing by selecting which team you wanted to support).</p>
<p>Yet another plan was to continue the course as a Twitter based game, that could involve participants external to the course as well. Setting it up as a game would allow me to imply things without properly saying them, diffusing some of the legal risk away from myself.</p>
<p>I realise these are many options, but they did not need all to work and stick. And I knew I would be more free to explain them once the course finished.</p>
<p>When ready, on Wednesday, I removed all content and forums, except for one forum. I also pinned one student post with an encouragement to fellow students to take ownership of their learning and join the Google Plus group associated to the course (in fact, this post is what triggered me to do this at that exact time). I removed video content because I wanted to encourage students who only watch video to consult the forums and notice that something was happening beyond business as usual. At the time I still felt very wary of the final peer-feedback exercise, and did not want these students to suddenly feel cheated. I intended to explain my actions on the very limited space I had left on the Coursera forums, at the best I could within my legal constraints.</p>
<p>As the atmosphere had evolved between Monday and Wednesday, it was clear to me that students would be critical of switching from Coursera to another web platform. Again, this was fine as I could point them to the numerous Terms of Use I had read in preparation of the course, and show them contradictions in their own reasonings about privacy, and overreliance on sales pitches. I had already started highlighting the social network aspect of Coursera on Sunday or Monday, and ultimately wanted students to treat all those options on an equal footing, and make critical choices.</p>
<p>Both Twitter and Youtube afford advantages that were required for me to be able to continue with the course content originally planned (hyperlinking to specific second or Tweet), while not requiring any login to consume passively.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fallout">
<h2>Fallout</h2>
<p>At this stage (Wednesday), I was given a 24 hour deadline by Coursera to reinstate the content on their servers. This request arrived at 12:30 AM my time. When I woke up, I asked my university for ethical guidance through one channel.  Before I could consult with my university, by 11AM, I was removed as an instructor and Coursera engineers started reinstating content in a suspiciously selective fashion, reeking of sanctioned censorship (part of the contracts is that the instructor has to sign away rights to modify the material).</p>
<p>Once my Coursera instructor rights were removed, in the interest of transparency, I immediately explained to the students what was going on through an etherpad document (for increased interactivity, still feeling under legal threat). Agreeing to a student request, I encouraged participants in that etherpad chat to share the document with the whole class. I also posted on the course forums and at the time I could not see that all my posts were being systematically deleted. I still do not know by whom.</p>
<p>Confusingly, some students still received e-mail notifications of my messages, and they started to suspect I was deleting them myself. In parallel, there was increasing speculation on the blogosphere that I was performing some form of social experiment. New students were not allowed to sign up, so newcomers had little access to information about what had happened in the course itself. This fed an increased paranoia of some students against me.</p>
<p>Despite all these misunderstandings, I was forbidden to clarify the situation with my students or the press. Later, I learned of misleading and false accusations made by Coursera to my university, and that Coursera used browsing behaviour information to support some of their claims.
I also learned that Coursera had issued legal threats against my university and was told that my own legal situation was precarious. Coursera temporarily suspended their agreement with my university. My assessment is that Coursera has so far successfully manipulated the media, my university and the students to damage my credibility and introduce doubts about my integrity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I regret the breakdown of trust that occurred during the preparation of the course between Coursera and me, since this left me with no good option when an external event (the Facebook Emotion experiment) disrupted my course plan. I think Coursera's actions after I removed the content, such as deleting my messages or misleading journalists and my university, caused undue stress to the students.</p>
<p>I can fully understand the perspective of students who would feel cheated or manipulated in some way since so much information was hidden away from them. I tried my best to convey that a lot was going on behind the scenes (and clearly said so many times, referring explicitly to contracts and denied requests for data transparency).</p>
<p>In the end, it feels like I have missed a chance to raise this debate and others more constructively. This is unfortunate since there are many more issues and opportunities of MOOCs I would have wanted to discuss in the third week:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>intellectual property for professors and associated labor issues (cf. <a class="reference external" href="http://ucscfa.org/2013/06/scfas-ongoing-discussion-concerning-ucscs-contract-with-coursera/">UCSC Faculty union resistance to Coursera</a> );</li>
<li>reportedly bad working conditions in the Coursera Global Translator Community, and the risks of crowdsourcing more components of teaching (Community TAs or alumni-led tutoring, for instance);</li>
<li>"partner"-walling of information in the Coursera Partner Portal that should be public (such as general best practices around MOOCs, data practices, <a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/thin-legitimacy-at-whisper-facebook-and-coursera.html">discussion around IRBs</a> etc);</li>
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJovz6IVzFU">vendor lock-in vs free/open source software</a>;</li>
<li>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.worklearn.org">merging of labour and educational markets, through crowdsourcing</a>;</li>
<li>technical interoperability of MOOC certificates;</li>
<li>corrupt personalisation of educational experiences;</li>
<li>erosion of academic freedom on commercial MOOC platforms;</li>
<li>interactions <a class="reference external" href="http://hci.uwaterloo.ca/faculty/elaw/citizenx/program.html">between MOOCs and citizen science or open democracies projects</a>;</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I missed a chance, but any of the other 103 Coursera partners, of which 25 or so are European or Swiss, have the option of starting a course on the same topics. I think it is very much needed: the shared interest of students and academics is to discuss these issues directly together at scale, without channeling this interaction through an intermediate corporation with obvious monetary interest. It is not clear that that many students are actually aware of any of those issues, highlighting the need for an urgent intervention on the topic.</p>

    <p>(For a more extended statement, see <a class="reference external" href="posts/extended-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-ii.html">here</a>)</p>
<p>My name is Paul-Olivier Dehaye, I am a mathematics professor at the University of Zurich. On June 23rd 2014, I started to teach a MOOC on Coursera, called <em>Teaching goes massive: New skills required</em>, which was intended to last for three weeks and include a component on business practices of MOOC providers. During the course delivery, my perception of the ethical issues surrounding the course changed, which led me to alter its delivery methods. This prompted a reaction by Coursera itself, and I was censored <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html#id8" id="id1">[1]</a>. In the fallout, I was also insulted and vilified online. Coursera used false or misleading information and deeply intrusive data held about the course and me to try to get my employer to launch a disciplinary procedure against me. Legal threats were also made.</p>
<p>Throughout my course, I acted with the interest of the European and Swiss public in mind. The ethical concerns that led me to change the course so abruptly hinged on strong similarities between the Coursera and Facebook Terms of Use, and the lack of transparency and accountability on the data collection and "research" practices at those companies.</p>
<p>There seems to be a very different perception across the Atlantic on privacy. As higher education moves online globally, it is important that the rest of the world does not adopt by default a Silicon Valley narrative on privacy issues in the educational domain. In my view, it is of primordial importance that European universities do not contribute to an erosion of the privacy values held by their local taxpayers <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html#id9" id="id2">[2]</a>. There are fundamentally different regulatory frameworks across the Atlantic: while privacy is seen in Europe as a human rights issue, it tends to be seen in the US as a tradable commodity, akin to a property right. If we consider instead developing countries, we are currently at a juncture point on this issue: while it is no doubt beneficial to offer access to educational material for their next generation, it is questionable whether this requires exporting business practices that are under increasingly intense scrutiny at home.</p>
<p>Privacy is only one of my concerns associated to Coursera and the current shaping of the MOOC market.</p>
<p>By muddling the thick legitimacy of our universities with the thin legitimacy of companies backed by venture capital, we risk devaluing our core: academic freedom. This dynamic happened in other industries, such as journalism, where it has led to a complete reversal of power structures, and a struggle of journalists to remain relevant <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html#id10" id="id3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond delivering educational materials worldwide, I am optimistic for the potential of MOOCs to create rich and meaningful experiences for students, through citizen science and open democracy activities for instance. There is a rapid impulse to apply similar combinations of educational and crowdsourcing techniques at a high cognitive level to the labor market <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html#id11" id="id4">[4]</a>. The utopia is that this can solve labor issues on a mass scale, enabling students to extract value from their degrees right away. More ambiguously though, through <em>turking</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html#id12" id="id5">[5]</a> and the privatisation of higher education certification on a large scale, this perniciously opens the door to seamless integration of these two markets into a more exploitative arrangement.</p>
<p>Finally, we should not forget what we lose by automating any component of an educational experience. Algorithmic culture comes with its own problems (especially when those algorithms are opaque <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html#id13" id="id6">[6]</a>), and big data is by definition discriminatory <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html#id14" id="id7">[7]</a> and hence a threat to any attempt at fostering equality in education.</p>

    <p>In my <a class="reference external" href="posts/thin-legitimacy-at-whisper-facebook-and-coursera.html">previous post</a>, I raised the possibility that the thick legitimacy of academics would be eroded by meddling it with the thin legitimacy of Coursera (or other MOOC providers). This echoes a useful distinction that was introduced by Jay Rosen, in the wake of the Facebook Emotions experiment.</p>
<p>Is this a theoretical risk? No, unfortunately. I can offer concrete cases tied to my Coursera MOOC <em>Massive Teaching: New skills required</em>. These should explain why that course went South.</p>
<p>What happened in my course is certainly complex, and this not meant to be an account of it. It discusses my reasoning about ethics, and focuses on the complexity of that interaction between thick and thin legitimacies. It ignores much of what happened when interacting with the students themselves. I finished my previous post with a video from my course outlining how different the startup and scientific processes are.</p>
<br><center>

</center>
<br><p>For my own teaching, I had adopted a model that I will call <em>Agile Teaching</em>. In fact, I explained what I meant by this in a separate video for the course:</p>
<br><center>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1xnBH0JDaU8?list=PLtqHSxfnLCmA_E4gk-tmklKoXfEoXSly9" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center>
<br><p>You can see several concepts there that reflect startup culture and the Agile methodology: failure and risks are OK, rapid iteraton, responsivity. This is similar to what Derek Bruff calls <em>Agile Teaching</em> (<a class="reference external" href="http://derekbruff.org/?page_id=1512">I think he originated the term</a>). In my case, I included delivery and production as part of the concept. This actually worked very well within my course, and the technique can certainly be applied to many topics.</p>
<p>However, since the topic was partly the business model of MOOC providers, and I was teaching so responsively, this technique is bound to hit some snags. During the preparation of the course, many interactions with the Coursera staff made me uncomfortable with their willingness to be transparent. This is bad practice but understandable, as I knew I was pushing them too fast and they were not used to that. I found other solutions, which included the a-posteriori-analysis-of-already-collected-data trick described in my previous post, for <em>teaching purposes</em>. When, <strong>during the course</strong>, the Facebook experiment makes the news, I went to re-read the section on education research in the Coursera Terms of Use.</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>Records of your participation in Online Courses may be used for researching online education. In the interests of this research, you may be exposed to slight variations in the course materials that will not substantially alter your learning experience. All research findings will be reported at the aggregate level and will not expose your personal identity.</p>
<p class="attribution">—<em>Online Education Research</em> in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/about/terms">Coursera Terms of Use</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The abrupt change in the course comes from my initial misunderstanding of this passage. The first time I read it, months before the course started, I understood that it referred to research performed by my peers, with thick legitimacy. But the Facebook experiment made it clear to me that I was mistaken: this is also and primarily used to justify research/product improvement with thin legitimacy, which can be very thin indeed. Coursera is also more dangerous in that sense than Facebook, since it actively attempts to clout itself with thick legitimacy and blend the two. To give a few examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>there are university administrators sitting on its <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/about/leadership">University Advisory Board</a>, but that power is, as far as I know, untested;</li>
<li>they rely on AAUP membership to select US partners;</li>
<li>they rely on Shangai rankings to select non-US partners.</li>
</ul>
<p>Between June 29th and July 3rd, I followed the same train of thought as Jay Rosen when writing his July 3rd Washington Post article, and ultimately see three ethical dangers tied to this blending of thick and thin legitimacies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>of abuses by academics, through the a-posteriori-analysis-of-already-collected-data trick (was what I myself did in the first week ethical? What about what I was going to do in the second week?)</li>
<li>of abuses against the learners by Coursera, just as with the Facebook experiment (do A/B tests of teaching interventions, robots on Coursera forums and a non-transparent list of other experiments require internal ethical approval? Where is Coursera going with the right to replay student comments at will?);</li>
<li>of abuses against professsors or their profession by Coursera (by devaluing the thicker legitimacy, the <a class="reference external" href="posts/moocs-journalism-and-digital-disruption.html">parallel with journalism and photography</a> is strong).</li>
</ul>
<p>I resolved that ultimately, in those conditions, I could not compromise my own thick legitimacy with the thinner legitimacy of Coursera. This was probably exacerbated by the topic of my course: by encouraging discussion about MOOCs in the course, and encouraging sharing of information about wishes and wants of students in the domain of MOOCs, I was in fact actively contributing to this blending of thick and thin legitimacies.</p>
<p>My response was to pull content from the course, while not abandonning my students (by still trying to explain this on the forums, within legal limits). This action prompted a reaction from Coursera, which was to give me a deadline to reinstate the content. Once given that deadline, I attempted to raise ethical concerns within my own university (address the issue at the level of thick legitimacy) to resolve the situation. Unfortunately, through different channels the thinner legitimacy prevailed, Coursera did not respect its own deadline and I was prevented from explaining myself with my students. Ironically, pretty much at the exact same time, Rosen was putting up this on the Washington Post site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the study’s methods became controversial in the public square, in the press, and in online conversation, that should be a moment for the university to shine. Our strengths include: Academic freedom. Knowing what you’re talking about. “Yes, we thought of that.” To the press or to anyone else who has questions about it, we should be happy to explain our research, including ethical issues as they arise. As academics, we pride ourselves on thinking these things through. And we have procedures! If you experiment on human beings you have to follow them. Academic research is not some free-for-all. It has to meet certain standards. When those standards become controversial in the public square we are happy to explain them. Because we know what we’re doing—</p>
<p>Except when we don’t. Reached by the Atlantic magazine, one of the academics researchers on the Facebook study chose silence rather than “let me explain our research design.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't choose silence, and this was not <em>research</em> with thick legitimacy. This was teaching with thick legitimacy. But Coursera itself is doing research with thin legitimacy, now or in the future, that I could not allow without more guarantees, that they had already refused four or five days before the Facebook experiment made the news. Possibly that stance is exaggerated, but I would welcome a discussion on this any time.</p>
<p>In any case, when the <a class="reference external" href="http://idstuff.blogspot.ch/2014/07/social-experiment-learning-experience.html">first blog post about the course came out</a>, this forced silence (and PR statements issued by the thin legitimacy outfit) led to suspicion that I was myself performing experiments, violating my own thick legitimacy by not following IRB protocol. The result? The author suggests the following in the last paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
From a research point of view this is FASCINATING.  I would love to get a hold of the discussion forum data for both discourse and corpus linguistics analyses. On the other hand, I fear that coursera, and all involved parties, are handling this one wrong again.  We are now entering the third and final week of this MOOC on MOOCs.  Let's see how this pans out.</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the author simultaneously complains about a situation, but wishes he could put his hands on the dataset so he could do research with thick legitimacy. He will of course never have access to that data, since Coursera owns it, from day one. Actually, there are many things that are not very inspiring about the technical architecture of the platform itself, so it might very well be that once an instructor deletes a forum, its content is unrecoverable. That's why I deleted forums when I could: to protect students, despite not having the opportunity to explain exactly why I did it (because of legal risk). Nothing has shown to me since that Coursera was able to retrieve that content.</p>
<p>The third week of the course was supposed to contain a final, peer-feedback quiz. That quiz would be asking students generic questions about MOOCs and what they learned in the course. The same author talks about that assignment <a class="reference external" href="http://idstuff.blogspot.ch/2014/07/youve-been-punkd-however-that-was.html">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
With regard to this "Assignment" I feel rather cynical on all fronts. On the one hand it feels like this is just another data-gathering stunt. So Paul ran his "experiment" and now he is collecting data to see what the learners say. The learners that didn't un-enroll from the course that is.  On the other hand, even if this is an earnest attempt to have learners introspect on this whole process, the attempt falls really flat on its face because this data is tainted. The questions don't address anything that happened in the course. It feels like these were written with the original learning objectives in mind, and as such it reduces this final exercise into a farce. It is a farce that does not respect the learners, and it is a farce of the educational process.</blockquote>
<p>It's all of this, actually, and more. This was merely a draft, meant to validate the idea with Coursera staff of data-gathering in this way. But it was <em>also</em> an earnest attempt to have learners introspect on this whole process, written with the original learning objectives in mind. I intended to tweak this draft later (maybe in a later iteration) into a more formal process, to be able to offer at scale personalised degrees that would reflect the learning that actually happened in the course. Once everything else happened, indeed the data <em>was</em> tainted and it didn't address anything that happened in the course. The final exercise was reduced into a farce that did not respect the learners. By that time though, I was not involved anymore, and had objected multiple times to running the course and this assignment without me.</p>
<p>After the assignment was completed by the students, that same author and some commenters on his blog <a class="reference external" href="http://idstuff.blogspot.ch/2014/07/massiveteaching-experiment-falls-on.html">managed to hack into Coursera</a> to get access to the data of all the students of the course. They were surprised at the diversity of responses, reflecting their own biases in understanding the complexity of the situation. On top, their interst in this data validated my own concerns: this data, beyond being useful for teaching, was valuable to research on the learner experience yet would be collected without IRB approval (it was merely used for teaching). My own thick legitimacy would enable its collection, yet I would have no option available to protect it from the eyes of Coursera, whose legitimacy is different and who might have genuine interest in that data.</p>

    <p>What do tech startup companies do? We all know the theory: they build a product their users want, and then optimise it to respond to those users' wishes. The darker and more practical side, particularly when the users don't pay for the product, is that these companies need to eventually attract money somehow. In response, their product often comes wrapped with a grandiose message, a skewed description of the problems and the solutions at hand. This is an attempt to build legitimacy, to attract users. But it can only be very thin legitimacy: while no profitable avenue has been found, all roads to there are still open, and this often forces compromises on the grandiose claims. Sometimes this leads to outright lies or creative explorations of the boundary of the privacy policy or terms of use.</p>
<br><img alt="../break.jpg" class="align-center" src="break.jpg" style="width: 475.0px; height: 267.0px;"><br><p><strong>Whisper</strong> is a company that blew it, big time. In theory, you can use it to anonymously send electronic postcards, and to receive replies. This generates lots of sharing of very private or sensitive information. Whisper generates money by curating the content that transits through them, and forming partnerships with news organisations. While Guardian journalists were at their HQ to investigate a potential business deal, the sales pitch they received markedly differed from the pitch normally given to users: Whisper commits <a class="reference external" href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/16/-sp-revealed-whisper-app-tracking-users">egregious and numerous violations of privacy</a>, or at least of the privacy levels promised in their own Terms of Service. Journalists have thicker legitimacy in society, and indeed in this case they really <em>had to</em> make public some of this information: some data was monitored by the US military, a clear no-no for a service used by some for whistleblowing. Judging from the pictures included in the article, the Guardian was there because it was interested in leaks of information from sensitive locations, but must have quickly determined that the legitimacy of Whisper was much too thin to actually partner with.
When this came out, the Whisper crew basically tried to accuse the journalists of grave violations of their own ethical standards (inventing characters, quotes, situations). That is not working out so well for Whisper right now.</p>
<p>Do we need to talk about <strong>Facebook</strong>? It has a history of eroding the public notion of privacy. While Zuckerberg now says that "Privacy is an evolving social norm", this statement hides that he very personally created this situation. He also said: "Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking things you are not moving fast enough" and even earlier "They trust me - dumb fucks". By <em>intentionally</em> breaking up parts of his own product repeatedly, he was able to lull the general public (or at least a significant enough portion of it) into compliance.</p>
<p>But now Facebook goes beyond that. Around June 29th 2014, an article was published in a scientific journal describing the analysis of data collected by Facebook. Generously described, the goal was to see how the newsfeed affected the emotion of Facebook users. If happy messages are promoted, will that make you happier? Of course, since this is A/B testing, you will need to test also the converse: if sad messages are promoted, will that make you more sad? Leave the service?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The reactions to the publication of the experiment were very interesting:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the public reaction was bipolar: either shocked or unimpressed;</li>
<li>Facebook thought it was in the clear due to its Terms of Use (even though they were changed after the fact). Sheryl Sandberg, COO <a class="reference external" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/02/sheryl-sandberg-facebook-study_n_5551828.html">apologized</a> for the <em>communication</em> around the experiment, saying that <em>they never meant to upset you</em>. Interesting: they never meant to upset you when telling you that they did previously mean to upset you for real. In any case, Facebook has since promised to self-regulate on the ethical front as well, for what that's worth.</li>
<li>Cornell defended its ethical IRB: it only formally intervened after the data was collected, so it didn't have to go through IRB, or at least it was easier to let it through. This obscures the fact that the scientists involved apparently informally consulted with Facebook <em>before</em> the data was collected.</li>
<li>James Grimmelmann, a law professor at the University of Maryland, is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/09/23/facebook-and-okcupids-psychological-studies-were-illegal-under-maryland-law-professor-argues/">arguing that what Facebook did is illegal under Maryland law</a>: because it presented its study as science, Facebook may have violated State law on human subject testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, Facebook is now out to erode the whole scientific process in the social sciences, and in a very good position to succeed. The lure of big data access is proving irresistible to scientists, and leading them to cut corners.
Jay Rosen, an NYU journalism professor, argued on July 3rd that this was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/07/03/dont-blame-facebook-for-screwing-with-your-mood-blame-academia/">toxic and corrosive to universities</a>, and clearly introduced this distinction between thick and thin legitimacies.</p>
<!-- epigraph:

When it comes to experimenting on human beings, we should distinguish between “thick” and “thin” forms of legitimacy. Research universities — including my own institution — must be especially attentive to this distinction. Their thing is “thick” legitimacy. Anything that takes them away from it undermines the institution. [..] Thin legitimacy is when the experiments conducted on human beings are: fully legal and completely normal, as in common practice across the industry, but there is no way to know if they are minimally ethical, because companies have no duty to think such matters through or share with us their methods. -->
<p>I think he is very correct. Both research and industry can break things, or even people (in psychology experiments). But there are operating procedures that differ in both worlds, and the ultimate burden when these legitimacies collaborate should be on the thick side, not the thin one.</p>
<p><strong>Coursera</strong> is very interesting in connection to the Facebook experiment: MOOCs will enable all kinds of data collection, that will lead to interesting research.</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>Records of your participation in Online Courses may be used for researching online education.

</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the Coursera Terms of Use are as vague as Facebook's, with the additional muddling that legitimate research is actually also performed, with proper IRB consent. It is <strong>also a minefield, since thick legitimacy is here encouraging data collection and giving it away to thin legitimacy</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When <a class="reference external" href="https://tech.coursera.org/blog/2014/09/11/talks-at-coursera-a-slash-b-testing-at-internet-scale/">Coursera discusses A/B testing, they invite someone from LinkedIn</a>. However grandiloquent, Coursera is the stuff of thin legitimacy. Their practices come from an industry that has spawned Google, Facebook, etc, and engineers move between those companies. At the 57:00 mark in the video, the head of analytics of Coursera shares what they themselves do. With the goal of improving the user experience, Coursera is already performing hundreds of experiments on its users. Should this be 3 pixels wide? 4? Fine. But they <strong>also</strong> do other experiments that get much closer to uncomfortable: A/B testing on emails to see which interventions help keep users engaged with the course, for instance. This can be seen as marketing (because of the clear distinction email/Coursera forums), but will that distinction remain clear once on mobile, when these same interventions occur in-app or via push notifications? For how long will Coursera need to maintain this distinction? Is this even legal in Maryland? The Coursera employee only cites a few experiments there, but there are actually hundreds. What are the others? Are those ethically sensitive? Who makes that distinction? Is he even supposed to think of that? Did anyone approve the ethics of using robots in Coursera forums, to answer student questions?</li>
<li>Once the data is owned by thin legitimacy, thick legitimacy has to fight to get back access to it. Coursera has a bad track record there. They make promises that they are not able or willing to keep.</li>
<li>There is a risk that the proximity and aligned interests of academics and Coursera would lead to abuses. The history of psychology is full of these cases, where scientists forgot that they were dealing with human subjects. I suspect the a-posteriori-analysis-of-already-collected-data trick will become widespread. Did anything in <a class="reference external" href="http://hapgood.us/2013/04/24/i-have-a-research-question-about-moocs-that-your-elite-institution-can-answer-in-under-an-hour/">this discussion</a> already step over that line? Probably not. But this post is over a year old, and I do know that when I encouraged transparency at Coursera, three days <strong>before</strong> the Facebook experiment came out, and explicitly mentioned that link, those issues were not understood. The post and comments between Mike Caufield, Alan Levine, Derek Bruff, Kate Bowles, Kristin Palmer and others highlight clearly how the IRB process can be gamed, and will be gamed (I am not saying or implying these posters did game it): one person with thick legitimacy collects the data via an outfit with thin legitimacy, another one with thick legitimacy analyses it. I also know that four months later I still don't hear any discussion about ethics coming from Coursera itself. I also know that Coursera has a Partner Portal, where such IRB discussions are encouraged but walled, while conveniently centralising information for Coursera itself (i.e. when they want to extend their service in one controversial direction, it will be easier to find partners with thick legitimacy who are willing to break things/people). When making the videos for my Coursera course <em>Massive Teaching: New skills required</em>, about a month earlier, I made some of this clear, although it was still phrased purely positively:</li>

<p>I just listened to <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/RitchinBtfInterview">an audio interview</a> conducted by Jonathan Worth for his <a class="reference external" href="http://phonar.org.uk">photography course #phonar</a>, back in 2013. The interviewee is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Ritchin">Fred Ritchin</a>, a journalist, professor and author. Originally I was attracted to the interview because of a question asked by Ritchin during a #ccourses hangout about trust. He essentially asked how an entire profession (journalism) could rebuild trust with its audience once it was lost. It felt as if he was hoping educators could help give an answer that is eluding his profession.</p>
<p>I have talked <a class="reference external" href="posts/building-trust-in-massiveteaching-through-visuals.html">before on this blog</a> of the parallels I see in Worth's approach in #phonar and mine with MOOC teaching. It looks like Ritchin can help explore these parallels.</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>The older paradigm for photojournalists was to simply record events, with the hope—and frequently the expectation—that people and their governments would be moved to respond to the injustices pictured, as witnessed by the impact of certain images during the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War. Given evolving media and political climates, however, including the billions of images now available online from all kinds of sources, the purpose and effectiveness of media, in particular of visual journalism, has been called into question. Bending the Frame, by author and critic Fred Ritchin, addresses the new and emerging potentials for visual media to impact society. Also encompassing online efforts, uses of video, and a diverse range of books and exhibitions, this volume aims for as wide-ranging and far-reaching a discussion as possible, asking the critical question: how can images promote new thinking and make a difference in the world?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In other words, digital photography and the web have led to a complete rethink of the role of professional photographers in society, and a struggle now to find their relevance in the wider world. The interview is at times a litany of missed opportunities for the New York Times. Ritchin recalls experiments conducted by the editorial side of the New York Times, playing with new multimedia options. This was in 1994, and was instigated by the business side of the journal, actually, full of hope that this could lead to new revenues. Immediately of course this was squashed when all newspapers started making their content freely available on the web.</p>
<p>Ritchin's response then was to use this new media to show a new kind of story: instead of showing war, he would show peace. His test case was Bosnia, where he tried to construct a nonlinear narrative around the experience of a photojournalist arriving there, and convey some of the disorientation  and confusion of the fallout of an ethnic war. In constructing this narrative, he had to put the photographer back in the center, because of the need for multiple links between elements in different photographs. This was completely new territory for anyone: even the idea of clicking on an image had to be explained to the readers.</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
It opened up the idea of instead of the New York Times and the photographer telling you what is going on, you as a reader have to become a collaborator with them to figure out what is going on, because in fact the photographer does not really know what is going on. The New York Times does not really know what is going on. We are all piecing it together. We all have our own experiences and we could apply our own experiences to the situation.</blockquote>
<p>This work was submitted at the time for a Pulitzer price in public service, but immediately rejected because it wasn't on paper. He says it took many years "for institutions to investigate the new possibilities of digital, of telling stories differently, of understanding the world differently." He recalls his own thinking back then, that deviated sharply from this insitutional chokehold.</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
If this is a revolution in media, we have to think in revolutionary ways, we can't just do what we were doing before. And photography is very good at being reactive. It reacts well to situations. There is a war, we photograph it. Spectacular imagery. But I prefer a pro-active photography, one that says "We don't want a war to happen". How can we make images prevent war? Or minimize it. How can we minimize global warming? How can we do things before the bad stuff happens?</blockquote>
<p>Eventually, the institutions lost: there was a "collapse of the mainstream, which puts the marginal in the centre, as a new practice or rather an old pratice, but one we didn't want to acknowledge before." Finally, the old institutions have had to acknowledge that all those experimental ideas were going in the right direction. But in the twenty years interval, they have suffered drastically from the intrusion of many new players on their turf, leading to his original question about trust. How do bona fide journalist now regain the trust of the general public, in a new landscape where their credentials are often ignored? Ritchin himelf introduces some clues: through a reversal of roles, between the amateur embedded in a community, and the professional outsider coming to report about the community. In 2013, he sees the "integration of both as the greatest challenge in journalism right now".</p>
<p>This is fascinating to me, and I can see many parallels with MOOCs and the institutional meddling at the frontline of online education. Photojournalism itself was born on the frontlines, with its founding fathers in the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_Photos">Magnum agency</a>, a cooperative of photojournalists.</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
They didn't discuss photography in the founding years. They discussed the world. They were happy to have survived World War II. [..] They were very political. They were interested in the future of people. It wasn't the future of photography. They were interested in the future of people. And I appreciated that, because I think the point of photography is not to celebrate itself but the point of photography is to be useful in the world, to try to get us to a better place. And that's the way they were working. To me that's what the original spirit of Magnum was.</blockquote>
<p>Maybe we need a cooperative of MOOC educators?</p>
<p>(Ritchin also talks about <em>horseless carriages</em>, and the technological determinism that prevents us to see unintended consequences of inventions such as digital photography. And Magnum has built its <a class="reference external" href="categories/social_machine.html">own social machine</a> to crowdsource the metadata tagging of its archive, which has led to the find of a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2011/06/crowdsourcing-and-discovery-of-hidden.html">hidden treasure</a>.)</p>

    <p>The European Union and Switzerland have agreements on free trade with the United States. One of those is <strong>Safe Harbour</strong>, which has <strong>drastic implication for privacy</strong>.

<p>The developments around <strong>MOOCs have very serious consequences for privacy</strong>. Dozens of European universities are working with US MOOC companies, spending lots, and ultimately contributing to data collection on millions of young EU citizens, all without clear purposes. There is very different cultural understanding across the Atlantic of the privacy protections of the relationships between platform and user, teacher and student and university and student. There are also very delicate (legal) constructions everywhere of what constitutes academic freedom.</p>
<p>All these ideas were extensively tested when I taught the class <em>Teaching goes massive: new skills required</em> on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/massiveteaching">Coursera</a>. Parts of this class were supposed to cover some of those issues, and explain directly to the students most concerned the privacy issues associated to Coursera's business models. Instead, I was <strong>censored</strong>, <strong>insulted</strong>, <strong>vilified</strong> and <strong>legally threatened</strong>, and Coursera used <strong>false, misleading or deeply intrusive</strong> data held about the course or me to get my employer to launch a disciplinary procedure against me (as even <a class="reference external" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/07/15/after-massiveteaching-questions-about-mooc-quality-control">hinted to a newspaper</a>!). On top, of course, my students have been left in the dark. And I have lost access to my course materials.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/about/privacy">Safe Harbour is a recourse here</a> for me (as it is to any European student on Coursera). I have submitted a request to Coursera, if only to get back access to the material created.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Ansip has decided to follow a suggestion of <a class="reference external" href="https://juliareda.eu/en/">Julia Reda</a>, a Pirate Party MEP, and host an online town hall meeting as well.</p>

    <p>In April 2014, I submitted a research proposal <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/mooc-research-proposal-using-crowdsourcing.html#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>. Its title is <em>Engineering Discovery in Mathematics</em>, after the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Discovery-New-Networked-Science/dp/0691148902">book</a> <em>Reinventing Discovery</em> by <a class="reference external" href="http://michaelnielse.org">Michael Nielsen</a>.</p>
<p>The proposal is in two part, an <a class="reference external" href="http://user.math.uzh.ch/dehaye/ERC/ExtendedSynopsis_Dehaye.pdf">Extended Synopsis</a> and a <a class="reference external" href="http://user.math.uzh.ch/dehaye/ERC/ResearchPlan_Dehaye.pdf">Research Plan</a>.</p>
<p>The main goal (project Z) of this four year proposal is to formalise mathematics. This is utterly unrealistic, and of course is to be considered a beacon very very far in the distance. <a class="reference external" href="posts/paul-bernays-lectures-at-eth-zurich.html">Fields medalist Voevodsky suggests a 500 year horizon</a> for this! To pile on to the difficulty of doing this, Thomas Hales explains his motivation of embarking on a formal proof of his own result, the proof of the Kepler conjecture. The background is that his paper had been accepted in one of the most prestigious mathematics journal, but conditionally on the grounds that his computer-generated proof was so complex that it could not be verified by even a team of 20 (very well trained) human referees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In truth, my motivations for the project are far more complex than a simple hope of removing residual doubt from the minds of few referees. Indeed, I see formal methods as fundamental to the long-term growth of mathematics.</p>
<p class="attribution">—Thomas Hales, Flyspeck project</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, mathematics and mathematicians are struggling to organise the information they produce, and the refereeing process will not be capable of responding to rapid advances in our capacities at theorem proving.</p>
<p>So why do I think my short four year proposal is interesting, alongside all those giants? Because it introduces a new idea in the picture, that of MOOCs. It is a fact that soon hundreds of students will be taking the same classes in parallel, and that graduate classes will be taken by dozens of students rather than handfuls. Also, professors in the more basic classes will start to collaborate more on content, and a formalisation effort can help in that direction. Admittedly, the proposal is not very specific, and exposes many ideas. I think the most promising avenue is in a bootstrapping process of the proofs, submitted as crowdsourced work in the context of a MOOC (with the expert explaining the material to formalise on video, say). Already <a class="reference external" href="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/1211.7012">it has been shown</a> that a lot of the Flyspeck poject proofs can actually themselves be automated, and the smart introduction of human mathematician labor can help tighten all the feedback loops.</p>
<p>In any case, this is going to be hard work, far in the distance. In the near future the goals will be more limited, and will probably benefit from MOOC-based research efforts in other disciplines too.</p>

    <p>I gave a talk on July 2nd about MOOCs. The goal was to explain to interested individuals the different potential futures of MOOCs, informed with the perspective of a mathematician. A lot of what I say is undoubtedly naive, but this was four months ago, an eternity in the MOOC world. And in any case I prefer to be attacked for things I said in a talk setting at my own institution to colleagues rather than things I {reportedly, supposedly} said to students in a closed setting.</p>
<p>The title of my talk was <em>What I am doing with MOOCs and why</em> (apologies for bad sound, one hour).</p>

<br><p>I gave this talk in anticipation of a conference co-organised the next day with Stanford in Zurich, <a class="reference external" href="http://user.math.uzh.ch/dehaye/edx_meeting.html">the first OpenEdX conference</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openedx.org">OpenEdX</a> is the platform that powers <a class="reference external" href="http://www.edx.org">edx.org</a>. This conference has now become a regular event, with the next one on the <a class="reference external" href="http://con.openedx.org/">Harvard campus</a>. At the time of the conference, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Sites-powered-by-Open-edX/93583d8f92cf692766180eca247960294114af7a">24 separate installation sites were listed</a> on the relevant Github pages, almost all of them in English. Four months later, the project now counts <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Sites-powered-by-Open-edX">47 sites</a> all over the world, a significant progress! It also now has <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/List-of-XBlocks">23 different publicly available Xblocks</a>, which are extensions of OpenEdX to customise it to particular needs (only a couple had been released back then).
As I explain this in the <a class="reference external" href="https://collab.switch.ch/p26oy3gl9aj/?launcher=false&amp;fcsContent=true&amp;pbMode=normal">first 4 minutes of this video</a>, privacy issues are very significant in Switzerland, Europe, Quebec and the United States and motivated me to convene the workshop. This comes right after the Snowden scandals, and it is very hard for large actors outside the USA to trust a service like Amazon Web Services. A positive outcome was that it helped crystallise a need for separate service vendors, which edX then helped to get started. There are now eight different <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/List-of-Open-edX-service-providers">commercial vendors</a>, happily customising the platform to suit new needs.  The conference also helped a lot of local startups/nonprofits get a jump start in the MOOC space, such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.blue-planet-life.org/">Blue Planet Life</a>.</p>

<p>A couple days later, I traveled to Delft to the edX Global Forum, to rock the boat there a bit as well. There was a panel on Open Source.</p>

<p>George Siemens' keynote there was very impressive in that it touched on very similar topics to some of my intended goals. I was a bit disappointed however in the answer he gave to a question I asked at the end of his talk. It really did seem like noone had yet practically considered how MOOCs might change entire disciplines for research, or create new ones.</p>

    <p>In 2011, when I applied to my current position as Swiss National Science Foundation Assistant Professor, I included an <a class="reference external" href="Annex_Dehaye.pdf">Annex</a> to the proposal, titled <em>Making data useful for mathematical collaboratories and the example of the LMFDB project</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>collaboratory</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/activating-mathematical-knowledge.html#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> is an organizational entity that spans distance, supports rich and recurring human interaction oriented to a common research area, and fosters contact between researchers who are both known and unknown to each other, and provides access to data sources, artifacts, and tools required to accomplish research tasks.</p>
<p class="attribution">—<a class="reference external" href="http://soc.ics.uci.edu/">Science of Collaboratories</a>, SNF survey 2007</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Already then, I highlighted a significant evolution in mentalities since a <a class="reference external" href="http://soc.ics.uci.edu/">reference SNF survey</a> of 2007. This trend was explained by Michael Nielsen in a TED talk at around the same time, also taking mathematics as basis for many of his examples.</p>
<br><center><iframe width="425" height="344" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/DnWocYKqvhw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></center>
<br><br><p>In the Annex, I make a distinction between <em>horizontal</em> and <em>vertical</em> projects. <cite>Horizontal projects</cite> are more infrastructure-like, <cite>with a wider mathematical audience, essentially the whole pure mathematical community</cite>.</p>
<blockquote>
I would expect this difficulty in integrating new data to be the main cause of the lack of mathematical collaboratories. As such, it should be solved as a horizontal rather than vertical problem. From now on, I only discuss this problem, i.e. the creation of a flexible and coherent mathematical database starting from heterogenous data.</blockquote>
<p>Pushed to the extreme, one could see this problem as <cite>integrating all compiled knowledge in mathematics</cite>, echoing a <a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/paul-bernays-lectures-at-eth-zurich.html#">description by Voevodsky</a>.</p>
<p>This was based around my experience for a few years with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lmfdb.org">LMFDB project</a>, which is aimed at integrating lots of mathematical data in the general area of L-functions (two of the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems">Clay Millenium problems</a> are in this area, the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">Riemann Hypothesis</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_conjecture">Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture</a>).</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of this annex is that it was, well, an annex. I knew including this as part of my main project could actually be hurtful and judged distracting to my main research proposal, since many of the ideas of <a class="reference external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/consultations/science-2.0/consultation_en.htm">Science 2.0</a> had not taken hold yet. Indeed, the Annex comes with a big disclaimer:</p>
<blockquote>
I have also described my more personal project, which is concerned with the integration of mathematical data for collaboratories. While I do not consider this project a mathematical project, I think it could be of great value to research in mathematics in general. I intend on pursuing it on the side as a service to the community, just as paper refereeing, outreach, CAS development, etc. I am only mentioning it here because of its (presumed) originality and wide audience.</blockquote>
<p>One year later, I coorganised a workshop at Edinburgh. The topic was <a class="reference external" href="http://aimath.org/pastworkshops/onlinedata.html">Online databases: from L-functions to combinatorics</a>, and it was meant to start unifying two separate areas in this horizontal problem.</p>
