    <p>I gave a talk on July 2nd about MOOCs. The goal was to explain to interested individuals the different potential futures of MOOCs, informed with the perspective of a mathematician. A lot of what I say is undoubtedly naive, but this was four months ago, an eternity in the MOOC world. And in any case I prefer to be attacked for things I said in a talk setting at my own institution to colleagues rather than things I {reportedly, supposedly} said to students in a closed setting.</p>
<p>The title of my talk was <em>What I am doing with MOOCs and why</em> (apologies for bad sound, one hour).</p>
<br><center><iframe width="425" height="344" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/NCLHWaYxMyM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></center>
<br><p>I gave this talk in anticipation of a conference co-organised the next day with Stanford in Zurich, <a class="reference external" href="http://user.math.uzh.ch/dehaye/edx_meeting.html">the first OpenEdX conference</a>. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openedx.org">OpenEdX</a> is the platform that powers <a class="reference external" href="http://www.edx.org">edx.org</a>. This conference has now become a regular event, with the next one on the <a class="reference external" href="http://con.openedx.org/">Harvard campus</a>. At the time of the conference, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Sites-powered-by-Open-edX/93583d8f92cf692766180eca247960294114af7a">24 separate installation sites were listed</a> on the relevant Github pages, almost all of them in English. Four months later, the project now counts <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Sites-powered-by-Open-edX">47 sites</a> all over the world, a significant progress! It also now has <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/List-of-XBlocks">23 different publicly available Xblocks</a>, which are extensions of OpenEdX to customise it to particular needs (only a couple had been released back then).
As I explain this in the <a class="reference external" href="https://collab.switch.ch/p26oy3gl9aj/?launcher=false&amp;fcsContent=true&amp;pbMode=normal">first 4 minutes of this video</a>, privacy issues are very significant in Switzerland, Europe, Quebec and the United States and motivated me to convene the workshop. This comes right after the Snowden scandals, and it is very hard for large actors outside the USA to trust a service like Amazon Web Services. A positive outcome was that it helped crystallise a need for separate service vendors, which edX then helped to get started. There are now eight different <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/List-of-Open-edX-service-providers">commercial vendors</a>, happily customising the platform to suit new needs.  The conference also helped a lot of local startups/nonprofits get a jump start in the MOOC space, such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.blue-planet-life.org/">Blue Planet Life</a>.</p>

<p>George Siemens' keynote there was very impressive in that it touched on very similar topics to some of my intended goals. I was a bit disappointed however in the answer he gave to a question I asked at the end of his talk. It really did seem like noone had yet practically considered how MOOCs might change entire disciplines for research, or create new ones.</p>

    <p>In 2011, when I applied to my current position as Swiss National Science Foundation Assistant Professor, I included an <a class="reference external" href="Annex_Dehaye.pdf">Annex</a> to the proposal, titled <em>Making data useful for mathematical collaboratories and the example of the LMFDB project</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>collaboratory</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/activating-mathematical-knowledge.html#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> is an organizational entity that spans distance, supports rich and recurring human interaction oriented to a common research area, and fosters contact between researchers who are both known and unknown to each other, and provides access to data sources, artifacts, and tools required to accomplish research tasks.</p>
<p class="attribution">—<a class="reference external" href="http://soc.ics.uci.edu/">Science of Collaboratories</a>, SNF survey 2007</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Already then, I highlighted a significant evolution in mentalities since a <a class="reference external" href="http://soc.ics.uci.edu/">reference SNF survey</a> of 2007. This trend was explained by Michael Nielsen in a TED talk at around the same time, also taking mathematics as basis for many of his examples.</p>
<br><center><iframe width="425" height="344" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/DnWocYKqvhw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></center>
<br><br><p>In the Annex, I make a distinction between <em>horizontal</em> and <em>vertical</em> projects. <cite>Horizontal projects</cite> are more infrastructure-like, <cite>with a wider mathematical audience, essentially the whole pure mathematical community</cite>.</p>
<blockquote>
I would expect this difficulty in integrating new data to be the main cause of the lack of mathematical collaboratories. As such, it should be solved as a horizontal rather than vertical problem. From now on, I only discuss this problem, i.e. the creation of a flexible and coherent mathematical database starting from heterogenous data.</blockquote>
<p>Pushed to the extreme, one could see this problem as <cite>integrating all compiled knowledge in mathematics</cite>, echoing a <a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/paul-bernays-lectures-at-eth-zurich.html#">description by Voevodsky</a>.</p>
<p>This was based around my experience for a few years with the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lmfdb.org">LMFDB project</a>, which is aimed at integrating lots of mathematical data in the general area of L-functions (two of the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems">Clay Millenium problems</a> are in this area, the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">Riemann Hypothesis</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birch_and_Swinnerton-Dyer_conjecture">Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture</a>).</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of this annex is that it was, well, an annex. I knew including this as part of my main project could actually be hurtful and judged distracting to my main research proposal, since many of the ideas of <a class="reference external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/consultations/science-2.0/consultation_en.htm">Science 2.0</a> had not taken hold yet. Indeed, the Annex comes with a big disclaimer:</p>
<blockquote>
I have also described my more personal project, which is concerned with the integration of mathematical data for collaboratories. While I do not consider this project a mathematical project, I think it could be of great value to research in mathematics in general. I intend on pursuing it on the side as a service to the community, just as paper refereeing, outreach, CAS development, etc. I am only mentioning it here because of its (presumed) originality and wide audience.</blockquote>
<p>One year later, I coorganised a workshop at Edinburgh. The topic was <a class="reference external" href="http://aimath.org/pastworkshops/onlinedata.html">Online databases: from L-functions to combinatorics</a>, and it was meant to start unifying two separate areas in this horizontal problem.</p>

    <p>I have learned a lot recently about online humiliation.</p>
<p>Monica Lewinsky's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/2014/06/monica-lewinsky-humiliation-culture">Vanity Fair piece</a> was very insightful. Indeed, if anyone would know about being the victim of online shaming, it would be her. Interestingly, she shares that a new stage of horror for her was achieved when she understood the impact his scandal had on her family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In September of 2010, the culmination of these experiences began to snap into a broader context for me. A phone conversation with my mother shifted the lens through which I viewed my world. We were discussing the tragic death of Tyler Clementi. Tyler, you will recall, was an 18-year-old Rutgers freshman who was secretly streamed via Webcam kissing another man. Days later, after being derided and humiliated on social media, he committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge.</p>
<p>My mom wept. Sobbing, she kept repeating over and over, “How his parents must feel … his poor parents.”</p>
<p>It was an unbearably tragic event, and while hearing of it brought me to tears, too, I couldn’t quite grasp why my mom was so distraught. And then it dawned on me: she was reliving 1998, when she wouldn’t let me out of her sight. She was replaying those weeks when she stayed by my bed, night after night, because I, too, was suicidal. The shame, the scorn, and the fear that had been thrown at her daughter left her afraid that I would take my own life—a fear that I would be literally humiliated to death.</p>
<p class="attribution">—Monica Lewinsky, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/2014/06/monica-lewinsky-humiliation-culture">Shame and Survival</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look at the year, 2010, that's twelve years after the facts. A lot of time for a mom to suffer with weakened trust in her daughter that she would take on life, with its good and bad days.</p>
<p>Something else that crossed my path is a <a class="reference external" href="http://mathbabe.org/2014/09/30/people-hate-me-i-must-be-doing-something-right/">post by Cathy O'Neil on her blog mathbabe</a>, where she discusses some ways she has built a thick skin and maintains confidence in herself, even in the face of criticism that can get very personal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But there’s one other thing I conclude when I piss people off: that I’m getting under their skin, which means what I’m saying is getting out there, to a wider audience than just people who already agree with me, and if that guy hates me then maybe 100 other people are listening and not quite hating me. They might even be agreeing with me. They might even be changing their minds about some things because of my arguments.</p>
<p>So, I realize this sounds twisted, but when people hate me, I feel like I must be doing something right.</p>
<p>One other thing I’ll say, which the article brings up. It is a luxury indeed to be a woman who can afford to be hated. I am not at risk, or at least I don’t feel at all at risk, when other people hate me. They are entitled to hate me, and I don’t need to bother myself about getting them to like me. It’s a deep and wonderful fact about our civilization that I can say that, and I am very glad to be living here and now, where I can be a provocative and opinionated intellectual woman.</p>
<p class="attribution">—Cathy O'Neil</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, the humiliation could get very deep in her psyche, but she makes her way of fighting it back very explicit. It's an utilitarian calculus, based on the scale of the positive impact she hopes to achieve versus the one negative comment she just had to face.</p>
<p>She ends the piece with this powerful line:</p>
<blockquote>
Fuck yes! Let’s do this, people! Let’s have ideas and argue about them and disagree! It’s what freedom is all about.</blockquote>

    <p>As part of the module on trust in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.connectedcourses.net">Connected Courses</a>, I would like to share some tricks that I have used to visually build trust across cultures. It was especially powerful for me to watch Jonathan Worth's video on <a class="reference external" href="http://phonar.org/2014/09/leveraging-you-why-in-answer-to-mike-wesch/">Leveraging your why</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/building-trust-in-massiveteaching-through-visuals.html#id5" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Worth offers that his "Why?" for #phonar is actually citizen journalism, and discusses a photo by John Stanmeyer, winner of the World Press Photo 2013 award.</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>So this brings me back to, this is my ‘why?’ So this image is the winning image from the World Press Photo this year, by a photographer called John Stanmeyer, and this is why it annoys me so much. Because it’s by a photographer called John Stanmeyer. These are African immigrants standing on a beach, trying to get a phone signal before they jump in the water. Let me just get this right, “on the shore of Djibouti City at night raising their phones in an attempt to capture an inexpensive signal from neighbouring Somalia”. These are the people that aren’t in my class. They’re holding these smart devices which can all take pictures, and yet it takes a photographer from New York to bring it back and we can now talk about it.  What these people need is to be able to be trusted and to be heard, and these are the people that aren’t in the class. So this is my why, and this is my way marker, so this is definitely the best and most exciting thing that’s come out of my classes.</p>

<p>Part of my efforts with my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.coursera.org/course/massiveteaching">Coursera course</a> <em>Massive Teaching: News skills required</em> were some interesting blend of Worth's efforts in #phonar and in #connected_courses. Let's first consider the exact opposite of what I did. Relax, prepare some popcorn, and watch the following video.</p>
<br><center><iframe width="425" height="344" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0rmJqQotDWo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></center>
<br><p>Clealy this video exploits the elite university brand together with a lot of pixie dust to try to cement this elite brand even more. The "why?" of this MIT video certainly shows.</p>
<p>Just as in Worth's #phonar course leading up to citizen journalism, I am hoping with parts of <em>Massive Teaching</em> to enable some form of citizen-MOOCing, to create a small distributed network of video production, with no sacrifice on the quality of the education provided. My sidegoal was <em>not</em> to find the cheapest way to produce video, but to find a visual style that could appeal equally to institutions (even very elite) and lonely individuals anywhere in the world <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/building-trust-in-massiveteaching-through-visuals.html#id6" id="id2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>The sidegoal was to make for a more homogeneous and egalitarian pool of video producers <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/building-trust-in-massiveteaching-through-visuals.html#id7" id="id3">[3]</a>, but it goes further. How do we enable anyone anywhere to build trust with <strong>connected diverse individuals</strong> (a concept that I used in a <a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/moocs-as-inventions-chals14.html">recent talk</a> and is obviously core to #ccourses)? Let's consider one of my videos, where the topic is precisely on tracking of individuals by large corporations, drawing parallels between educational analytics and AdWords style advertising.</p>

<br><img alt="../crib.jpeg" class="align-right" src="crib.jpeg" style="width: 216.0px; height: 288.0px;"><p>Note a few things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>it uses easily findable DUPLO pieces <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/building-trust-in-massiveteaching-through-visuals.html#id8" id="id4">[4]</a> and paper cutouts;</li>
<li>I feel that using kids' toys produces emotional responses and increases trust;</li>
<li>my hands are there, and that makes the videos still personal (contrast with the expense at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:CEDE@EPFL">CEDE@EPFL</a> for their <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agbe9B5l_VI">invisible hand effect</a>);</li>
<li>the production process is first audio, then video, and the two are completely separate (I replay the audio when filming the video). In this way I actually first write the transcript, record a reading, and then illustrate. It makes translations very easy: simply re-record the sound, at the pace of the video.</li>
<li>I designed a recording studio out of IKEA furniture pieces (a crib, for instance for a cage, so it is easy to attach camera, light, etc); IKEA is not cheap enough but it gives wide reach. I have confidence that this can be improved drastically, by posting on sites such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ikeahackers.net/">IKEAhackers</a>;</li>
<li>I encouraged my students to do the same, by describing my process as throgouhly as possible (done here again);</li>
<li>None of those cheap tricks are new, it is mere borrowing of on-the-street intelligence of High School teachers and the Maker movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated, one of the sidegoals was to enable anyone to do this, and for anyone to create trust with anyone else, without necessarily going through a central authority (like that provided by my Coursera course). For this purpose, I selected some articles to help guide students on what might build trust across cultural divides, such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.featureshoot.com/2013/03/photos-of-children-from-around-the-world-with-their-most-prized-possessions/">this one</a>, which clearly echoes the emotional response I was referring to earlier.</p>
<p>So what happened with <em>Massive Teaching</em>?</p>
<p>Well, despite my best efforts it turns out that the fact that Coursera owned the channel was still <em>massively</em> important. I might have made sure I owned all the content, and diluted as much as possible all ambient brands, I still needed Coursera for its reach (or at least I felt I did!). Going through them was not a smart way to challenge the general status quo in MOOCs, but the interesting paradox of #massiveteaching is that ultimately it is not the content that went missing, but rather the human (me, the instructor). The content was instead reinstated (well, actually only partially and with questionable motives), and I was unable to access the sources anymore, thereby losing some of my own content. This paradox was then compounded by further issues of trust and disinformation, where again access to communication channels was crucial. This account of course omits any of the students' perspectives, which must have been wildly different, depending on the activities they actually engaged in. With the instructor gone, only disaster was possible.</p>

    <p>When I was in Oxford, I had the best view in the world from my apartment. Off Merton Field, above Deadman's Walk onto <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Church_Meadow,_Oxford">Christ Church Meadow</a>. Uninterrupted grass landscape into the river, with rolling mist up to the river most mornings, <em>Lord of the Rings</em>-style. In fact, Tolkien's office <em>was</em>  the apartment upstairs, and I like to think the view inspired him. How come, in a cramped city like this, I could enjoy this same view decades later, centuries after the construction of the building I was living in? Well, because in the byzantine world of Oxford real estate, one college (ChristChurch) owned that land, while another owned grazing rights for cattle on it (forgot which, presumably Merton itself). Not that tourists would see cattle in that field: every year, the college with grazing rights would rent sheep for just one day, and move it there. The theory was that <strong>if they didn't exercise their right, they would legally lose it</strong>, and the other college could build whatever they wanted there and ruin the view (Wikipedia mentions a road that was defeated). <strong>The pace at Oxford allowed to think this through: custom is built over centuries, and preserved with yearly activities.</strong></p>
<p>Why this long preamble?</p>
<p>I was just in Goteborg for the #Chals14 conference, where a big part of <a class="reference external" href="posts/moocs-as-inventions-chals14.html">my schpiel was that we should not succumb to the free-is-a-lie mantra of MOOCs</a> and resist narrow views of the "Internet happening to education" (quoting George Siemens) based around technological determinism (quoting Evgeny Morozov). The afternoon session was in Swedish, so I was distracted and looking at Twitter. One person that I am following, Aral Balkan, tweeted this:</p>
<center>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>Is <a href="https://twitter.com/Schiphol">@schiphol</a> airport breaking EU law? They told me today that I could not opt of the full-body scanner.

<p>Balkan is a privacy advocate, who has been trying to raise the attention of people to the <a class="reference external" href="https://aralbalkan.com/notes/spyware-2.0/">Spyware 2.0 model</a> employed by many companies now: in his Orwellian view, by offering free services, large corporations manage to convince us to give away all our data, so they can spy on us. He is leading the <a class="reference external" href="http://ind.ie/manifesto">Indie-tech movement</a> and peripherially (?) in the <a class="reference external" href="http://dmlcentral.net/blog/doug-belshaw/reclaiming-web-next-generation">Reclaim the Web movement</a>, which also has declinations in the MOOC space (for instance with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wired.com/2014/09/known/">Known</a>). His tweet got me pretty upset: a few years ago, Schiphol security classified a present from my mom, high quality Belgian chocolate paste, as a liquid. Back then I had checked, and legally they were, at least at the time, within their rights: individual employees have ultimate classification decision and chocolate paste is indeed a grey area. Still, because of an arbitrary decision by a person who gleefully threw away a present in the bin, I was forced to make-do with Swiss chocolate for a while, a clearly inferior proposition. If you want to dismiss my reasons to do this, you could say that I have a score to settle with Schiphol security.</p>
<img alt="../schiphol-hand.jpg" class="align-right" src="schiphol-hand.jpg" style="width: 540.0px; height: 360.0px;"><p>As luck would have it, on my flight back to Zurich from Goteborg, I was flying through Schiphol. On the very same day as Balkan. On top, the <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/aral/status/514736935978680320">twitter thread</a> had a ton of links to the relevant laws and websites, which were completely unambiguous. So all the work of retesting this more "scientifically" was cut out for me. In fact, <strong>one could argue that as an academic this is part of my work: to challenge institutions, spread knowledge, and contribute to society. These last two points made by many #Chals14 participants in the context of MOOCs.</strong> I agree and generally take it seriously, especially living in a country where academic freedom is in the constitution (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19995395/">Art. 20</a>), where I am paid well to think, connect dots, etc. My view of academia might smack of arrogance and overreach, but bear with me.</p>
<p>A few hours later, I myself landed in Schiphol, and got out of the transit area so I would have to intentionally get back through security. Since I could not print my legal backups on time, I had written on my hand the references to European regulation, 185/2010 4.1.1.10, a <a class="reference external" href="http://english.nctv.nl/themes/Counterterrorism/Security_and_civil_aviation/Security_Scan/FAQ_3.aspx">Dutch website URL</a> and my plan:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>refuse body scanner twice;</li>
<li>ask for an explanation of my rights;</li>
<li>question the legality of their setup;</li>
<li>ask for the name of the person I was talking to;</li>
<li>ask to speak to a supervisor;</li>
<li>iterate.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I approached the security scanner, I looked around. Nowhere was it written that I could opt out. It was simply written that I should "feel free to ask questions". In Balkan's case, this was not helpful at all: since the security employee seems to have violated the law, Balkan couldn't just point to a sign and say he was wrong. The fact that there was no sign is, according to me, already a violation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before being screened by a security scanner, the passenger shall be informed of the technology used, the conditions associated to its use and the possibility to opt out from a security scanner</p>
<p class="attribution">—<a class="reference external" href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:02010R0185-20140409&amp;from=EN">European regulation 185/2010</a>, last line of article 4.1.1.10</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I had to finally talk to a Schiphol security officer and refuse the scanner, our interaction validated all the care I put in preparing this (and my general approach to a few similar challenge-the-authority projects I am involved in): his reaction was simply to ask me "Why?", why I was refusing. If there is one thing I learned this summer, it is to ask myself "Why?" and have a good answer to this question <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id9" id="id1">[1]</a>. In this case, I could definitely answer it right away: "Because this is my right". <strong>By keeping a pretense of being citizen beta, I got the officer to volunteer the reason why he himself asked me "Why?"</strong>: he volunteered "because sometimes people don't have the right information and think those are X-rays machines going through their skin" (regardless of the validity of the assertion, this is irrelevant to the fact that European law still allows me to opt out). I repeated that I was still refusing, and he said that was indeed my right, let me get around the scanner and started patting me down.</p>
<p>To emphasize: <strong>this particular officer knew from the start that I it was my right to opt out</strong>. While being perfectly courteous, he was making assumptions of my own ignorance, expecting to enlighten me with information about his very expensive, super advanced, and ultimately useless piece of technology <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id10" id="id2">[2]</a>.  This <strong>explanation was supposed to somehow impress me, and lead me to willingly give away my own rights as a EU citizen (on EU soil)</strong>. Given that I had gone to Goteborg to partly talk about technological determinism, with quotes of Zuckerberg on the evolving nature of privacy (including the "dumb fucks" quote, page 11 of <a class="reference external" href="goteborg-final.pdf">my slides</a>), this was adding another layer of irony... There possibly was arrogance in my assumptions about my role as an academic, but certainly there were in the assumptions the officer was making: he didn't know about the Oxford sheep (presumably), all the necessary tabs opened and ready on my laptop, the writing on my hand, or the fact that I have quite a bit of experience with EU law (in the context of a separate private matter, I have previously encouraged the European Commission to initiate an <a class="reference external" href="http://ec.europa.eu/eu_law/your_rights/your_rights_en.htm">infringement procedure</a> against my home country, Belgium. This is a <em>highly</em> recommended and free legal avenue, available to any European citizen and maybe even resident).</p>
<p>Once he had patted me down, and I had effectively gone through security, it was time to lay some of it out. Of course, I was quickly bounced around to the shift supervisor (who looked quite a bit senior). <strong>René was genuinely concerned and wanted to do the right thing: he took  pictures of my screen to get the relevant EU law lines and the original tweets. I told him to look for the #HelloSchiphol hashtag on Twitter. He thanked me.</strong></p>
<p>But again he dismissed Balkan as just a tweeter among others, and I had to insist that he actually had many followers who care about privacy, that he is a big shot taking on Google, etc. I shouldn't have had to do that, and neither should it have mattered that I am a university professor, yet he did remark on the fact <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id11" id="id3">[3]</a>. One can argue about my method and its transparency, but <strong>by playing dumb I actually got further</strong> than just flashing legal printouts right away, since I now have <strong>one more data point on how Schiphol security officers respond to seemingly unprepared citizens concerned with airport security</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, this experience with Schiphol security was very positive, and I don't have a grudge against them anymore (provided they add relevant signage).</strong></p>
<p>Now I want to contrast this with another security theatre incident <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id12" id="id4">[4]</a>, this time in the MOOC space. In September 5th <a class="reference external" href="http://hackeducation.com/2014/09/05/beyond-the-lms-newcastle-university/">talk by Audrey Watters</a> about the Learning Management System, she says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The LMS was — is — designed as an Internet portal to the student information system, and much like the old portals of the Dot Com era, much like AOL for example, it cautions you when you try to venture outside of it. “ re you sure you want to leave AOL?” “Are you sure you want to leave the VLE?” “Aren’t you scared to be on the Web?” “There are strangers and strange ideas out there. Stay within the LMS! Stay within AOL!"</p>
<p class="attribution">—Audrey Watters</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>There I was in Schiphol, facing the same security theatre to cross an actual physical portal.</strong></p>
<p>Watters might have been picking on older technologies (AOL and LMSes), but on that very same day (Sept 5th) the very same issues resurfaced for more modern technology, through Jonathan Mayer. Mayer is a lawyer, but also a PhD student at Stanford in computer science. Like Balkan, he is a big advocate for privacy.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>So far his research has cost <a class="reference external" href="http://mashable.com/2014/09/23/stanford-google-privacy-research/">Google 22.5M USD in fines</a>, and what he has said in interviews has earned him the distinction of being <a class="reference external" href="http://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/iab-mozilla/">labeled by the online advertising trade union</a> a "Bolshevik of the Internet world" <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id13" id="id5">[5]</a>.  He is 26.</p>
<p>He is also teaching a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/course/surveillance">course on Surveillance Law</a> on Coursera (i.e. how the NSA, FBI, etc are legally accessing information about US citizens). A week before his course, he published a <a class="reference external" href="http://webpolicy.org/2014/09/04/a-funny-thing-happened-on-the-way-to-coursera/">blog post detailing some security flaws of Coursera itself</a>. This was at his personal blog, but I assume he would consider this part of his work.</p>

<p>Coursera's response was given in a <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/96686805237/response-to-reported-vulnerability-in-instructor-access">blog post</a>.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>In his talk at the Coursera Partners' Conference, Dellamaggiore has a background slide with the actual class that his Infrastructure team takes: Cryptography I, on Coursera of course, by Dan Boneh (ironically from Stanford). I went and looked at that course.</p>
<br><img alt="../crypto1.jpg" class="align-center" src="crypto1.jpg" style="width: 936.6px; height: 431.9px;"><br><p>Sure enough, 9 minutes into the first video, <em>social engineering</em> is highlighted as nullifying the value of encryption and many other security methods. Given that Coursera superprofessors are supposed to be the best of the best (at their very very narrow discipline), and given the way academia works, I expect a fair share of Coursera professors to be greying a bit. <strong>I want to question how the decision was made by Coursera to think those professors could be trusted with this level of access</strong>. I have had access to more information than the general public to help answer this question, but do not know enough at this time to actually answer it. <strong>I am not willing to reshare publicly the information I still have because of personal legal risk.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>That's great, but how do we keep data from falling in the wrong hands, say they try to access our physical machines in the cloud or our production databases or what not. So this slide is a little bit more technical, so bear with me, I will kind of go through it quicker.</p>
<p class="attribution">—Nick Dellamaggiore - Infrastructure Lead, a few seconds later</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This lack of public transparency is itself is a concern, in the context of the <a class="reference external" href="http://asilomar-highered.info">Asilomar convention</a>. <strong>Without more transparency from Coursera on their data policies, I have genuine concern that Coursera itself is just using security theatre for commercial advantage</strong> <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/security-theatre-in-airports-and-academia.html#id16" id="id8">[8]</a>.</p>
<p>In case it is not clear at this stage, I still have a score to settle with Coursera, but I try to be a patient man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone’s not going to follow the practices, that’s something that society faces in general, and that’s why we have police and courts [..] In the academic world, we don’t need police and courts, but we have academic discipline, we have academic institutional standards, we have research standards.

</blockquote>
<p>Goel is textually correct of course. But he is also intentionally misleading (by offering this generic quote in an article about a course that I ran). And he is also unintentionally short-sighted, for very many reasons. One is that he indeed reminds me of looking up the local rules.</p>

    <p>Over at his blog, Jonathan Rees <a class="reference external" href="http://moreorlessbunk.net/technology/as-the-learning-management-system-turns/">discusses the decision of the Colorado State University in Fort Collins to switch LMSes</a>, from Blackboard to Canvas.</p>
<p>He makes sly references to the fact that this blog post starts hitting very close to his own "home", since he is working himself at Colorado State University - Pueblo.</p>
<p>In a previous post on the <a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/coursera-contracts-of-stony-brook-roma-unc-colorado-kentucky-michigan-utoronto-ucsc.html">Coursera contracts</a>, I gathered together all the Coursera contracts that I could find online. This was in fact partly a response to repeated appeals he has done in the past for faculty to speak up across universities (see first line of <a class="reference external" href="http://paulolivier.dehaye.org/posts/edtech-policies-part-ii.html">this post</a>).</p>
<p>One of those contracts was from the University of Colorado system, it is <a class="reference external" href="coursera-Colorado.pdf">here</a>. I was wondering how the decision was taken in Colorado of joining Coursera in the first place, and if faculty were consulted on this. The comments are below, feel free to contribute (even anonymously if you would like).</p>
<p>Now, I was also wondering how he (and other professors and administrators) would react to this present post, over which he has no control (and we haven't discussed this beforehand).</p>
<p>To increase likelihood that someone would respond, I also posted a comment on his blog sending readers here.</p>

    <p>I just finished giving my talk on <em>MOOCs as inventions: opportunities and risks</em> in Goteborg, at the <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23chals14&amp;src=typd">#chals14</a> meeting. This is a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/chals14?fref=ts">reunion of Swedish universities</a> convened by Jonas Gilbert (Chalmers University Library) to discuss MOOCs.</p>
<p>My slides are available <a class="reference external" href="goteborg-final.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the talk, I discussed the idea that MOOCs are <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_machine">social machines</a> put in the hands of professors (thanks to my PhD student <a class="reference external" href="http://www.math.uzh.ch/index.php?id=assistenten&amp;L=&amp;key1=4144&amp;key2=&amp;key3=&amp;keySemId=">Helen Riedtmann</a> for boiling down my ideas to this simple statement), and quoted Evgeny Morozov, which I am reading at the moment.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it was much better to be last speaker of the morning, to offer a (hopefully constructive) balance to some of the other points made earlier. It also lead naturally to interesting discussions (including with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/the-president-and-vice-presidents/Pages/karin-markides-president.aspx">Karin Markides</a>, who asked me a few questions above my pay grade. It is much easier to convey these ideas offline than online, but indeed the audience is smaller and different).  Still, the digital world was interesting too: I was glad to see how Twitter added to the talk <strong>for me</strong> afterwards (something I am not used to, since very few mathematicians use Twitter), which helped me assess how my ideas were received. In a talk about MOOCs' risks and opportunities, someone immediately called me up on the risks of the opportunities, with a reference to Jaron Lanier:</p>
<center>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/chals14?src=hash">#chals14</a> The social machine; I wonder what Jaron Lanier would say about that. Read "You are not a gadget" for a critical take in this.</p>— Thommy Eriksson (@KuggenMedialab) <a href="https://twitter.com/KuggenMedialab/status/514714933813338113">September 24, 2014</a>
</blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</center>
<p>Now adding this to my reading list, since in fact he seems to talk a lot about mathematics too! It was also good to meet <a class="reference external" href="http://jorg.pareigis.se/">Jorg Pareigis</a>, a fellow <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23ccourses&amp;src=typd">#ccourses participant</a>.</p>
<p>Two quick mementos for myself:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I have now traveled to the first 15 countries to constitute the European Union.</li>
<li>I have never been before in such last minute trouble with computers: still private Google Slides locked out of my account, requiring Google two-factor authentication through a dead cell phone... Literally managed to get to the slides as I was walking to the stand.</li>

    <img alt="../bernays.jpg" class="align-right" src="bernays.jpg" style="width: 177.0px; height: 237.0px;"><p>The ETH Zurich hosts every year the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gess.ethz.ch/news/pbl">Paul Bernays lectures</a>. This the type of lecture where people expect a Nobel prize winner to show up. Well, unless it is a mathematics one (the topic rotates among a few sciences), in which case it is OK if the speaker only has a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal">Fields medal</a>.</p>
<p>This year, it was the latter. The speaker was <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Voevodsky">Vladimir Voevodsky</a> from the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Advanced_Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> in Princeton (the same institute where Einstein and many other brilliant scientists were coopted following great successes).</p>
<p>Voevodsky's initial success was in proving the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milnor_conjecture">Milnor conjecture</a>, but he hasn't stopped there. He has announced a proof of the Bloch-Kato conjecture as well, and is now working on Homotopy Type Theory.</p>
<p>This theory is tied to the foundations of mathematics. To the layman, it really asks deep questions about what mathematics is, and how mathematics is constructed and improved, both by computers and humans. In some ways, he is trying to scientifically map out mathematics, and during the talk suggested a 500 year horizon to do that (part of many bombastic and exciting claims made by very smart mathematicians, such as Thomas Hales at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJx8bFQbHsA">end of his lecture here</a>, who are willing to challenge the statu quo). Of course, one needs to start "small", and this is what Voevodsky explained in Zurich, his vision of the <em>Foundations of Mathematics</em>.</p>
<p>For this he had three times one hour, which he sensibly divided into: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vladimirias/2014_Paul_Bernays_Lectures/blob/master/2014_09_Bernays_1%20presentation.pdf?raw=true">past</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vladimirias/2014_Paul_Bernays_Lectures/blob/master/2014_09_Bernays_2%20presentation.pdf?raw=true">present</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vladimirias/2014_Paul_Bernays_Lectures/blob/master/2014_09_Bernays_3%20presentation.pdf?raw=true">future</a>.</p>
<p>I want to focus here on the "past" talk. He started it by quoting wikipedia's definition of <em>Foundations of Mathematics</em>:</p>
<img alt="../wikipedia-foundations.jpg" class="align-center" src="wikipedia-foundations.jpg" style="width: 616.5px; height: 236.0px;"><p>and highlighted that there were two parts to this definition: the <em>mathematical concepts</em> and the <em>metamathematical concepts</em> (the <em>structures that form the language</em>). He then went on to explain the presence of this dichotomy through the ages: discrete vs. continuous, pure vs. applied,  theorem vs. problem (<em>an inquiry the
answer to which is a construction of an object</em>), and eventually touched on this account of what mathematics is:</p>
<img alt="../grassmann.jpg" class="align-center" src="grassmann.jpg" style="width: 617.5px; height: 308.5px;"><p>Voevodsky's interpretation of what Grassmann is saying is thus: <strong>mathematics is seen as rising from many independent roots and acquiring wholeness only through the intertwining of the lines arising from these roots</strong>.</p>

    <p>Scholarship of the XXIst century will include a lot of research on teaching, learning, and citizen science. MOOCs offer fantastic opportunities in this area. The XXIst century should also probably include scholarship of its own labor practices, or at least some concerted effort to stay afloat of developments in the profession. Asymmetric information can hurt badly in negociations. For this reason, it could be helpful to gather all <strong>Coursera Framework Agreements</strong> that have landed on the internet (so far) in one place. Those agreements bind the university administration and Coursera, and package within them the actual contract to be signed later by the instructor (and guests), both with the administration and with Coursera. On top, any user of Coursera requires an account which is bound by its own Terms of Service <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/coursera-contracts-of-stony-brook-roma-unc-colorado-kentucky-michigan-utoronto-ucsc.html#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>By simply googling around (mostly for <em>Coursera Framework Agreement</em>), I was able to find the following eight contracts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-Colorado.pdf">U Colorado</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-Kentucky.pdf">U Kentucky</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-Michigan.pdf">University of Michigan</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-Roma.pdf">University of Roma (Sapienza)</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-Stony_Brook.pdf">University of Stony Brook</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-UCSC.pdf">UC Santa Cruz</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-UNC.pdf">University of North Carolina</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="coursera-UToronto.pdf">University of Toronto</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Not all of those are signed, some are just preliminary and might not match the final version.
Some of those were originally obtained through Freedom of Information requests, while others were obviously misplaced. Some seem to have been removed from the web since, so I put them back here. <strong>The more interesting aspects here are the subtle variations between these contracts</strong>.</p>
<p>Should you have one that you want to share, feel free to send it to me.</p>
<p>I also include the following <a class="reference external" href="coursera-UNC-CDA.pdf">Course Development Agreement</a> for UNC. This contract is packaged within the Framework Agreement, and one is signed for each course at UNC, according to the CFA. It is relatively short, but refers to external guidelines located on the Coursera Partner Portal (i.e. online, inaccessible without an account with different permissions than a regular student account).</p>
<p>It includes the rollout policy for a particular course: 1.d.i and 1.d.ii dictate that the content should be uploaded one month ahead of the course start for the first week of content, and two weeks ahead for the second week, but "<em>[these] will not apply to the University Courses beginning in the Fall of 2013 if the achievement of these requirements is not practical or not feasible</em>". UNC <a class="reference external" href="http://gazette.unc.edu/2013/02/26/unc-to-offer-moocs-with-coursera/">joined Coursera</a> on February 2013.</p>
<p>The CDA also includes the following:</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>
<strong>Course reusability</strong>: Ensuring that the content can be easily reused in <strong>subsequent offerings of the course for which the instructor might not be involved</strong>. This includes:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Avoiding references to particular dates in lecture videos (e.g., "The homework will be due next Monday, March 4" or "It’s a beautiful summer day today");</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> After the first offering of the course, <strong>systematically editing/removing references to dates and episodes that are specific to the first offering of the course</strong> (e.g., an announcement about correcting a typo on the final exam, or about extending due dates because of Hurricane Sandy), as well as references to activities for which instructor involvement is necessary (e.g., "We hope to see you at the next live Google+ Hangout").</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="attribution">—Coursera Development Agreement, to be signed by Coursera instructors at UNC (emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have read through quite a lot of this, so if you have any question feel free to ask!</p>

    <p>For the first post in my series on edtech privacy policies, terms of service and contracts, click <a class="reference external" href="posts/edtech-policies-part-i.rst">here</a>.</p>
<p>In his recent post <em>You are not alone</em> on the Salaita affair, Jonathan Rees <a class="reference external" href="http://academeblog.org/2014/09/08/you-are-not-alone/">comments on the social media policies</a> enacted at the Colorado, Kentucky and New Mexico state systems. He encourages other professors to speak up:</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>Few of us can be sure whether or not our campus is really the canary in the higher education coal mine. However, better mine safety everywhere eventually benefits everyone with a pick and shovel. The more we professors talk to each other, both on social media and off, the better off we’ll all be when bad ideas surface that may someday affect us all.</p>
<p class="attribution">—Jonathan Rees</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The evocation of the canary is very beautiful. It resonates quite a bit: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a> was after all founded to help the Swiss develop their own railway systems. In any case, looking back at his writing, Rees has really dug in the Coursera <a class="reference external" href="http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/dear-superprofessors-your-labor-has-value/">labor</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/09/03/unbundle-yourself/">practices</a>. This seems like a good opportunity to continue my <a class="reference external" href="posts/edtech-policies-part-i.html">edtech policies series</a>.</p>
<p>After some googling, one can easily find the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.colorado.edu/bfa/INITIATIVES/CourseraK2013.pdf">Coursera Framework Agreement</a> between <em>Coursera Inc., a Delaware corporation [..] and the Board of Regents of the University of Colorado [..] for the benefit of the University of Colorado Boulder</em>.</p>
<img alt="../colorado-google.jpg" class="align-center" src="colorado-google.jpg" style="width: 545.0px; height: 123.0px;"><p>Independently of any stereotype that as an academic <a class="reference external" href="posts/the-academic-social-machine-part-I.html">I hate capitalism</a>, another stereotype could be that I also quite like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/paul-olivier-dehaye/insane-travel-insurance-policy/228313430077">to read contracts</a>. Of course this one makes for a particularly interesting read: it is supposed to hint at how MOOCs will be sustainable for the UC system and how Coursera, Inc. will outlast its <a class="reference external" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coursera">85M dollars "gifts" from venture capital</a>.</p>
<p>The contract details the various rights and obligations of the parties involved, the different Coursera monetization strategies (ten instead of the eight like in the <a class="reference external" href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/400864/coursera-fully-executed-agreement.pdf">2012 Michigan contract</a>), the Course Acceptance Procedures, the responsibility of the <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.coursera.org/post/72903326640/introducing-the-2014-rotation-of-courseras-university">University Advisory Board</a> when things go wrong, etc. Of particular interest to me is how it already packages in Exhibit G-1 the relationship between an instructor and the university.</p>
<p>It also includes the following gem:</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>I hereby release, discharge, and promise not to sue Company and its affiliates, successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, demands, costs and/or causes of actions of any nature arising out of or in connection with the exercise of any rights herein granted, including, without limitation, any claim for infringement, right of publicity, libel, slander, defamation, moral rights, invasion of privacy or violation of any other rights relating to any Content I upload, share or otherwise provide in connection with use of the Platform.</p>
<p class="attribution">—Exhibit G-1, Form of Agreement for Instructors and Guest Presenters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, IANAL but once the instructor signs this, s/he is giving free pass to Coursera for any libel, slander, defamation, invasion of privacy etc against her/himself. I don't know the backstory on how the faculty at Colorado accepted this, but would be very interested. At UCSC, the collective bargaining chapter has on the other hand been <a class="reference external" href="http://ucscfa.org/2013/06/scfas-ongoing-discussion-concerning-ucscs-contract-with-coursera/">very critical</a>, as has been discussed in <a class="reference external" href="posts/edtech-policies-part-i.html">part I</a> of this series.</p>
<p>Rees' words on this are very apt, to his credit a year ago already:</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>At some point you have to realize that you do not work in a vacuum. Teaching a MOOC or not teaching a MOOC, speaking out in favor of them or remaining silent – these things all have an effect on the rest of your profession. You can’t just declare that MOOCs are the future and let the chips fall where they may. You have the ability to influence what kind of future we’ll all face.</p>
<p class="attribution">—Jonathan Rees (<a class="reference external" href="https://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/2013/09/01/dear-superprofessors-your-labor-has-value/">Labor Day 2013</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can we guess what XXIst century education might guarantee in terms of labor rights? Is there an online strike clause in any of them? All I could find is called <em>Force Majeure</em>:</p>
<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>Each party is excused from performance of this Agreement (other than for any payments due) and will not be liable for any delay in whole or in part caused by the occurrence of any contigency beyond the reasonable control of such Party. These contigencies include, without limitation, war, sabotage, insurrection, riot or other acts of civil disobedience, act of public enemy, failure or delay in transportation, act of government or any agency or subdivision thereof affecting the terms of this Agreement or otherwise, judicial action, <strong>labor dispute</strong>, student disorders, accident, fire, explosion, flood, severe weather, natural disaster or other <strong>act of God</strong>, shortage of labor, hardware failure, interruptions or <strong>failure of the Internet</strong> or third-party network connections or incapacity of an instructor.</p>
<p class="attribution">—<em>Force majeure</em> clause 19.6 of University of Colorado Boulder contract (emphasis mine)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know if those risks are sorted in any way, but can't help but notice that <em>act of God</em> sits right between
<em>labor dispute</em> and <em>failure of the Internet</em>.</p>
<p>Apparently Rees has a show on the road. The title is <a class="reference external" href="https://moreorlessbunk.wordpress.com/category/academia/aaup/">Educational Technology, Budgetary Priorities and Academic Freedom</a>. Should be good.</p>
