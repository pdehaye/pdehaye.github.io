    <br><p>Do we all have something to hide? Hopefully so.</p>
<p>My life was scheduled to change on September 12th 2001. I was supposed to move to the US, through New York, to study at Stanford for my PhD. That didn't happen, of course. The day before, as I was saying goodbyes to friends at home, we watched horrific images on television. We learned through the TV ticker tape that all transatlantic flights were grounded. I remember staying in bed for the whole week after that, sick from egoistic stress: it felt as if World War III was about to erupt, and I was moving across the world in the middle of all that. Still, in the days that followed, I tried day after day to get a seat on a plane so I could move on time for my classes. Eventually, I flew in on September 17th, still routed through New York. I remember feeling relief when we took off. When we arrived though, we circled around the long plume of smoke and I felt overwhelmed with what had actually happened. Around me, all the passengers were New York residents, sobbing as they discovered the changed landscape of their city.</p>
<p>I flew on, and landed in California. Like everyone else, I rushed to buy a bike after realising how humongous the campus is. I remember making all the efforts to settle in: social security number, campus card, bank account, etc. Bought a phone and all the other dorm essentials. The general impression (on campus) was that the "events" were an East Coast thing, still far from the relatively peaceful West. Anyways, there was little time to reflect: it was the first week of classes, where I quickly understood how hard my first year would be leading up to my qualification exams. It was my 20th birthday that week. The older grad students had organised a party at the end of the first week, so I celebrated with them.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-safe-harbor">
<h2>What is Safe Harbor?</h2>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles">International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles</a> are a set of regulations between the United States and either the European Union or Switzerland, which allow individuals based in those countries to claim back their personal data from US-based corporations.</p>
<p>Copy-pasting from wikipedia, these principles must provide:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<strong>Notice</strong> - Individuals must be informed that their data is being collected and about how it will be used.</li>
<li>
<strong>Choice</strong> - Individuals must have the option to opt out of the collection and forward transfer of the data to third parties.</li>
<li>
<strong>Onward Transfer</strong> - Transfers of data to third parties may only occur to other organizations that follow adequate data protection principles.</li>
<li>
<strong>Security</strong> - Reasonable efforts must be made to prevent loss of collected information.</li>
<li>
<strong>Data Integrity</strong> - Data must be relevant and reliable for the purpose it was collected for.</li>
<li>
<strong>Access</strong> - Individuals must be able to access information held about them, and correct or delete it if it is inaccurate.</li>
<li>
<strong>Enforcement</strong> - There must be effective means of enforcing these rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is meant to replicate a level of privacy protection similar to that enjoyed at home. Some companies implement these rules as services that you can activate yourself (like Facebook and Twitter, for instance, although some are arguing <a class="reference external" href="http://europe-v-facebook.org">Facebook is not transparent enough</a>).</p>

<div class="section" id="why-the-course">
<h2>Why the course?</h2>
<p>I do believe that MOOCs offer many opportunities. Beyond providing educational material at a very large scale, they might for instance also help strengthen democracy or enable new discoveries. I have <a class="reference external" href="posts/mooc-research-proposal-using-crowdsourcing.html">submitted a grant proposal along those lines</a>. Since utopian ideas often get compromised and ultimately shaped by commercial interests, I started in May 2013 to take a closer look at contracts between MOOC providers and educational institutions. Coursera was a natural choice for my focus: my university has partnered with them, they use closed source software (which increases lock-in), and they are the leading MOOC provider right now.</p>
<p>What I read really bothered me, for a wide array of reasons. While the utopian vision of MOOCs (free-education-for-all) is compelling, these contracts reflect a very disturbing approach to that goal. In my opinion these contracts will have large societal implications, should they become the norm: disappearance of academic freedom, of the free agency of students, and complete disappearance of any form of privacy when learning. When I tried to communicate this around me, I encountered a clear lack of information on the subject. Getting past the utopian vision took time. Once there, many responded that my concerns were valid and worth discussing. In any case, this approach was ineffective: MOOC partnership decisions are often made by university administrations, based on factors other than those that drove my concerns.</p>
<p>I decided that the best way to proceed was to teach a MOOC on the topic. The most natural place to do so was of course Coursera, and it also seemed natural to address the course to professors, i.e. individuals who might be able to affect decisions at their own institutions or in their local communities. It would also allow me to reach out to the more "typical" Coursera students and explain to them the contracts that are constructed around their learning. Finally, I thought it would be interesting to see the capacities at Coursera to reflect on their own practices.</p>
<p>I understand the paradox of teaching on Coursera about concerns relating to teaching on Coursera, but made the calculation that the benefits outweigh the costs in this case.</p>

    <p>(For a more extended statement, see <a class="reference external" href="posts/extended-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-ii.html">here</a>)</p>
<p>My name is Paul-Olivier Dehaye, I am a mathematics professor at the University of Zurich. On June 23rd 2014, I started to teach a MOOC on Coursera, called <em>Teaching goes massive: New skills required</em>, which was intended to last for three weeks and include a component on business practices of MOOC providers. During the course delivery, my perception of the ethical issues surrounding the course changed, which led me to alter its delivery methods. This prompted a reaction by Coursera itself, and I was censored <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html#id8" id="id1">[1]</a>. In the fallout, I was also insulted and vilified online. Coursera used intentionally misleading information and deeply intrusive data held about the course and me to try to get my employer to launch a disciplinary procedure against me. Legal threats were also made.</p>
<p>Throughout my course, I acted with the interest of the European and Swiss public in mind. The ethical concerns that led me to change the course so abruptly hinged on strong similarities between the Coursera and Facebook Terms of Use, and the lack of transparency and accountability on the data collection and "research" practices at those companies.</p>
<p>There seems to be a very different perception across the Atlantic on privacy. As higher education moves online globally, it is important that the rest of the world does not adopt by default a Silicon Valley narrative on privacy issues in the educational domain. In my view, it is of primordial importance that European universities do not contribute to an erosion of the privacy values held by their local taxpayers <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html#id9" id="id2">[2]</a>. There are fundamentally different regulatory frameworks across the Atlantic: while privacy is seen in Europe as a human rights issue, it tends to be seen in the US as a tradable commodity, akin to a property right. If we consider instead developing countries, we are currently at a juncture point on this issue: while it is no doubt beneficial to offer access to educational material for their next generation, it is questionable whether this requires exporting business practices that are under increasingly intense scrutiny at home.</p>
<p>Privacy is only one of my concerns associated to Coursera and the current shaping of the MOOC market.</p>
<p>By muddling the thick legitimacy of our universities with the thin legitimacy of companies backed by venture capital, we risk devaluing our core: academic freedom. This dynamic happened in other industries, such as journalism, where it has led to a complete reversal of power structures, and a struggle of journalists to remain relevant <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html#id10" id="id3">[3]</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond delivering educational materials worldwide, I am optimistic for the potential of MOOCs to create rich and meaningful experiences for students, through citizen science and open democracy activities for instance. There is a rapid impulse to apply similar combinations of educational and crowdsourcing techniques at a high cognitive level to the labor market <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html#id11" id="id4">[4]</a>. The utopia is that this can solve labor issues on a mass scale, enabling students to extract value from their degrees right away. More ambiguously though, through <em>turking</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html#id12" id="id5">[5]</a> and the privatisation of higher education certification on a large scale, this perniciously opens the door to seamless integration of these two markets into a more exploitative arrangement.</p>
<p>Finally, we should not forget what we lose by automating any component of an educational experience. Algorithmic culture comes with its own problems (especially when those algorithms are opaque <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html#id13" id="id6">[6]</a>), and big data is by definition discriminatory <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/short-statement-on-massiveteaching-part-i.html#id14" id="id7">[7]</a> and hence a threat to any attempt at fostering equality in education.</p>

<p>I just listened to <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/RitchinBtfInterview">an audio interview</a> conducted by Jonathan Worth for his <a class="reference external" href="http://phonar.org.uk">photography course #phonar</a>, back in 2013. The interviewee is <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Ritchin">Fred Ritchin</a>, a journalist, professor and author. Originally I was attracted to the interview because of a question asked by Ritchin during a #ccourses hangout about trust. He essentially asked how an entire profession (journalism) could rebuild trust with its audience once it was lost. It felt as if he was hoping educators could help give an answer that is eluding his profession.</p>

In principle, Safe Harbour is a good idea: it creates <strong>little (business) friction</strong> but ensures some form of <strong>citizen oversight</strong> over the fastest evolving areas of e-commerce, by <strong>enforcing transparency</strong> <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/coursera-and-safe-harbour-of-student-data.html#id4" id="id1">[1]</a>. It is being heavily tested though: in light of the Snowden revelations, there is growing understanding that this data originally held for commercial reasons is also a leverage of power. Andrus Ansip, the European Commissioner for Digital Single Market (designate)  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.euractiv.com/sections/innovation-enterprise/ansip-threatens-suspend-safe-harbour-data-agreement-us-308962">acknowledged</a> <a class="reference external" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/europe-digital-nominee-demands-stronger-u-s-data-rules/">this</a> in his hearings to be confirmed.</p>

    <p>I gave a talk on July 2nd about MOOCs. The goal was to explain to interested individuals the different potential futures of MOOCs, informed with the perspective of a mathematician. A lot of what I say is undoubtedly naive, but this was four months ago, an eternity in the MOOC world. And in any case I prefer to be attacked for things I said in a talk setting at my own institution to colleagues rather than things I {reportedly, supposedly} said to students in a closed setting.</p>
<p>The title of my talk was <em>What I am doing with MOOCs and why</em> (apologies for bad sound, one hour).</p>
